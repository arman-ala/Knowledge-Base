### I don’t have time to plan!

- All of my Band 8 and 9 students have one thing in common. They plan for at least 5–10 minutes before writing.

- Planning helps you to:
  - Analyse the question and answer it correctly.
  - Think of relevant ideas.
  - Structure your answer.
  - Save you time.
  - Reduce the amount of grammar and vocabulary mistakes.

# Question Analysis

Let's continue with an example:
- More students are deciding to study science-related subjects at university rather than more traditional subjects.
	- What is the main cause of this?
	- What effect will it have on society?

## Idea Generation

- **5 different strategies:**
  - Brainstorming
  - Mind-mapping
  - 6 questions method
  - Examples method
  - Coffee shop method

- Everyone thinks of ideas differently, and you should pick the one that works best for you.

In IELTS Writing Task 2, effective idea generation is essential for developing a coherent and well-supported essay. The task requires candidates to present arguments, provide examples, and structure their response within a limited time frame (approximately 40 minutes). Below, I outline five distinct idea generation strategies—brainstorming, mind-mapping, 6 questions method, examples method, and coffee shop method—tailored to the IELTS context. Each strategy is explained in depth, including its application, benefits, and a specific example based on a sample IELTS Task 2 question: *"Some people believe that the best way to increase road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"*

### 1. Brainstorming
**Explanation**:  
Brainstorming involves generating a list of ideas freely and spontaneously without immediate judgment or organization. This method encourages a rapid flow of thoughts, allowing candidates to explore various angles of the topic. In IELTS Task 2, it is particularly useful for identifying arguments, counterarguments, and supporting points. The process typically begins with the main topic, followed by jotting down related ideas as they come to mind. Once a sufficient number of ideas are collected, they can be categorized or prioritized to form the essay structure.

**Benefits**:  
- Encourages creativity and broad thinking.  
- Helps uncover a wide range of perspectives quickly.  
- Flexible for time-constrained environments like the IELTS exam.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Write the topic: "Increasing the minimum legal age for driving to improve road safety."  
- **Step 2**: List ideas:  
  - Pros: Reduces accidents by inexperienced drivers, allows more maturity, lowers insurance costs.  
  - Cons: Limits young people’s independence, may not address reckless driving, economic impact on families.  
- **Step 3**: Organize: Use pros for the "agree" argument and cons for the "disagree" counterargument.  
- **Application**: This could lead to a paragraph arguing that maturity reduces accidents (e.g., "Raising the age limit to 21 could decrease crash rates, as studies show younger drivers are more prone to risk-taking behavior."), balanced with a counterpoint about independence.

### 2. Mind-Mapping
**Explanation**:  
Mind-mapping is a visual technique where the main topic is placed at the center of a page, and related ideas branch out in a non-linear fashion. This method suits visual learners and helps organize thoughts hierarchically. In IELTS Task 2, it allows candidates to connect ideas (e.g., causes, effects, solutions) and identify the essay’s structure, such as an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Branches can represent arguments, examples, or counterarguments, with sub-branches for details.

**Benefits**:  
- Enhances visual organization and clarity.  
- Facilitates the identification of relationships between ideas.  
- Useful for structuring complex topics with multiple perspectives.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Place "Increasing driving age" in the center.  
- **Step 2**: Draw branches:  
  - "Pros": Maturity (sub-branch: fewer accidents), Safety (sub-branch: statistical evidence).  
  - "Cons": Independence (sub-branch: job access), Alternatives (sub-branch: better education).  
- **Step 3**: Develop: Use "Maturity" and "Safety" for the "agree" side, and "Independence" and "Alternatives" for the "disagree" side.  
- **Application**: This could result in a body paragraph stating, "Advocates argue that a higher driving age enhances safety, as mature individuals are less likely to engage in reckless driving, supported by data showing a 20% reduction in accidents among drivers over 21."

### 3. 6 Questions Method
**Explanation**:  
This method involves answering six key questions—Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?—to generate ideas comprehensively. In IELTS Task 2, it ensures a thorough exploration of the topic by addressing different dimensions, such as stakeholders, actions, locations, timing, reasons, and implementation. This structured approach helps candidates develop balanced arguments and avoid overlooking critical aspects, making it ideal for essay questions requiring analysis.

**Benefits**:  
- Provides a systematic framework for idea generation.  
- Ensures coverage of all relevant aspects of the topic.  
- Supports the development of detailed and logical arguments.

**Example**:
This method helps you by asking very specific questions and generating ideas that way.
- **Who?** Students. Big tech companies like Apple.
- **What?** Computer science, engineering, programming.
- **Why?** Money, the internet, modern culture.
- **Where?** Silicon Valley, Stanford, M.I.T.
- **How?** Apply to university, graduate with a degree.
- **When?** Last 10–20 years.  

**Example**:  
- **Who?**: Governments, young drivers, parents.  
- **What?**: Increase the minimum driving age to 21.  
- **Where?**: Urban and rural areas.  
- **When?**: Implemented over the next five years.  
- **Why?**: To reduce accidents caused by inexperience.  
- **How?**: Through legislation and public awareness campaigns.  
- **Application**: This could lead to a paragraph like, "Governments should consider raising the driving age to 21 in both urban and rural areas, as this would address the high accident rates among inexperienced drivers, implemented through new laws and educational programs."

### 4. Examples Method
**Explanation**:  
The examples method focuses on generating ideas by thinking of real-world or hypothetical examples that relate to the topic. In IELTS Task 2, this strategy strengthens arguments by providing concrete evidence, which is highly valued in the scoring criteria (e.g., Task Achievement). Candidates begin with the essay question, then brainstorm specific instances—historical events, personal experiences, or global trends—that support or challenge the statement, followed by linking these examples to the argument.

**Benefits**:  
- Adds credibility and specificity to the essay.  
- Aligns with IELTS expectations for supporting points with examples.  
- Stimulates creative thinking through relatable scenarios.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Identify the topic: "Increasing the driving age for safety."  
- **Step 2**: List examples:  
  - Country A raised the age to 20, reducing teen accidents by 15%.  
  - A friend struggled with job access after a delayed license.  
- **Step 3**: Link to argument: Use the country example for "agree," and the friend for "disagree."  
- **Application**: This could result in a sentence such as, "Evidence from Country A, where the driving age was increased to 20, demonstrated a 15% decline in teenage accidents, supporting the case for stricter age limits."

### 5. Coffee Shop Method
**Explanation**:  
The coffee shop method involves imagining a conversation with diverse individuals (e.g., experts, citizens, critics) in a casual setting, such as a coffee shop, to generate ideas from multiple perspectives. In IELTS Task 2, this role-playing technique helps candidates anticipate different viewpoints—supportive, opposing, or neutral—enhancing the essay’s balance and depth. Candidates mentally simulate a discussion, noting the arguments each "person" might raise, then select the most relevant points.

**Benefits**:  
- Encourages consideration of varied opinions.  
- Improves the ability to present a balanced argument.  
- Mimics real-world debate, aiding critical thinking.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Imagine a coffee shop discussion: A safety expert, a young driver, a parent.  
- **Step 2**: Note perspectives:  
  - Expert: "Raising the age to 21 will save lives due to maturity."  
  - Driver: "It limits my freedom to work or study."  
  - Parent: "Education on driving skills could be a better solution."  
- **Step 3**: Use in essay: Combine expert and parent views for a nuanced stance.  
- **Application**: This could lead to a paragraph like, "A safety expert might argue that increasing the driving age to 21 enhances road safety due to greater maturity, while a parent might suggest that improved driver education could achieve similar results without restricting young people’s independence."

### Choosing the Best Method
As noted, individuals generate ideas differently, and the effectiveness of each method depends on personal preference and cognitive style. Candidates should experiment with these strategies during practice to identify the most comfortable and productive approach. For instance, visual learners may prefer mind-mapping, while those who thrive on structure might favor the 6 questions method. The key is to select a method that maximizes idea generation within the exam’s time constraints, ensuring a well-developed essay with clear arguments and supporting details.

By mastering these techniques, candidates can confidently address IELTS Task 2 prompts, tailoring their approach to produce a coherent and persuasive response.


In IELTS Writing Task 2, expanding your idea generation toolkit with additional techniques can enhance your ability to craft a well-rounded and persuasive essay. The bonus idea generation techniques—What is the most obvious answer?, If you asked 100 people this question, what would be the common answer?, What would someone different from you think?, and If you were trying to win an argument, what idea would you use?—offer unique perspectives to enrich your response. Below, I provide a deep explanation of each method, its application in the IELTS context, and an example based on the sample question: *"Some people believe that the best way to increase road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"*

---

### 1. What is the Most Obvious Answer?
**Explanation**:  
This method involves identifying the most immediate or straightforward response to the question, which often reflects conventional wisdom or a widely accepted viewpoint. In IELTS Task 2, this technique helps establish a starting point for your argument, providing a foundation that can be supported, challenged, or expanded upon. It is particularly useful for quickly generating an initial thesis or topic sentence, ensuring you address the prompt directly before delving into nuanced analysis.

**Benefits**:  
- Provides a quick and logical entry point into the topic.  
- Aligns with the examiner’s expectation of addressing the question explicitly.  
- Serves as a basis for building more complex arguments.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Consider the obvious answer: "Increasing the minimum driving age improves road safety."  
- **Step 2**: Analyze: This seems logical because younger drivers are often less experienced.  
- **Step 3**: Develop: Support with evidence or challenge with exceptions.  
- **Application**: This could lead to an opening sentence: "The most apparent solution to enhancing road safety is to raise the minimum driving age, as it may reduce accidents caused by inexperienced drivers, though alternative measures warrant consideration."

### 2. If You Asked 100 People This Question, What Would Be the Common Answer?
**Explanation**:  
This technique involves predicting the majority opinion by imagining a survey of 100 people, reflecting societal trends or general consensus. In IELTS Task 2, it helps gauge public perception, which can be used to support a popular argument or highlight a need for counterarguments if the consensus is flawed. This method encourages candidates to think about cultural or demographic influences, adding depth to the essay by grounding it in a broader context.

**Benefits**:  
- Reflects real-world perspectives, enhancing relevance.  
- Encourages a balanced view by considering majority and minority opinions.  
- Strengthens arguments with a sense of shared understanding.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Imagine asking 100 people: Most might say, "Yes, raising the age limits improves safety."  
- **Step 2**: Reason: People associate youth with recklessness, based on media reports of teen accidents.  
- **Step 3**: Use: Incorporate this into the argument, with a counterpoint if needed.  
- **Application**: This could result in a paragraph: "If surveyed, 100 people might commonly agree that increasing the driving age to 21 enhances safety, citing the prevalence of accidents among teenagers; however, this view overlooks the potential effectiveness of stricter training programs."

### 3. What Would Someone Different From You Think?
**Explanation**:  
This method involves adopting the perspective of someone with a different background, age, culture, or experience (e.g., an older person, a teenager, a policymaker). In IELTS Task 2, it fosters empathy and critical thinking, enabling candidates to present a balanced essay by including opposing or alternative viewpoints. This technique is valuable for demonstrating awareness of diverse opinions, a key aspect of achieving a high band score in Coherence and Cohesion.

**Benefits**:  
- Promotes inclusivity and balance in argumentation.  
- Encourages critical evaluation of personal biases.  
- Enhances the essay’s sophistication by addressing multiple perspectives.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Imagine a teenager’s view: "Raising the age limit restricts my freedom."  
- **Step 2**: Analyze: A young person might prioritize independence over safety statistics.  
- **Step 3**: Integrate: Use this as a counterargument.  
- **Application**: This could lead to a sentence: "A teenager might argue that increasing the driving age to 21 unduly restricts their autonomy, particularly in rural areas where public transport is limited, suggesting a need for alternative safety solutions."

### 4. If You Were Trying to Win an Argument, What Idea Would You Use?
**Explanation**:  
This technique involves selecting the strongest, most persuasive idea to defend your position, as if you were debating an opponent. In IELTS Task 2, it helps candidates focus on the most compelling evidence or reasoning to support their stance, aligning with the Task Achievement criterion. This method encourages strategic thinking, prioritizing ideas that are robust, evidence-based, or emotionally resonant to convince the reader (examiner).

**Benefits**:  
- Focuses on the most impactful and defensible points.  
- Enhances persuasiveness, a critical skill in argumentative essays.  
- Encourages the use of strong examples or data to support claims.

**Example**:  
- **Step 1**: Identify the strongest idea: "Statistical evidence shows fewer accidents with older drivers."  
- **Step 2**: Strengthen: Cite a hypothetical study (e.g., "a 25% reduction in crashes").  
- **Step 3**: Argue: Use this to win the "agree" side.  
- **Application**: This could result in a key point: "To win an argument, one might emphasize that statistical data reveals a 25% reduction in road accidents when the driving age is raised to 21, underscoring the efficacy of this measure over other interventions."

### Integrating These Techniques into IELTS Writing Task 2
These bonus methods complement the earlier strategies (brainstorming, mind-mapping, etc.) by offering alternative lenses to generate ideas. Candidates can combine them for a holistic approach:  
- Start with "What is the most obvious answer?" to establish a baseline.  
- Use "If you asked 100 people..." to reflect public opinion.  
- Incorporate "What would someone different think?" for balance.  
- Conclude with "If you were trying to win an argument" to finalize the strongest point.  

For the sample question, a candidate might begin with the obvious answer (raising the age improves safety), predict a common public agreement, consider a teenager’s dissent, and argue with statistics to persuade. This multi-method approach ensures a well-developed essay, adaptable to personal preferences and the specific task, maximizing performance under the exam conditions.
