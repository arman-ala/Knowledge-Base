You will have 20 minutes to write your response.

**How will it get graded?**

You will be graded on four criteria(معیارها). Each criterion(معیار) receives a band score (1-9), which are then averaged to determine your final task 1 writing score.

Below are brief explanations of each criterion. For more detailed information, you can download the full descriptors from the internet as they are publicly available.

| Coherence and Cohesion       | Your ability to logically organize and arrange your response and the information within it.                                        |
| Lexical Resource             | Your ability to use a range of vocabulary accurately.                                                                              |

**How should I answer the task?**

This will all be explained in this obsidian notebook which information is gathered or provided (a few of the parts) by **==Arman Ala==**, but here are some general tips before we begin.

- **Limit yourself to 20 minutes.** You have one hour for the writing part of the test and you also need to write an essay. The essay is worth more marks and is longer, so you should spend 40 minutes on this—if you exceed your 20 minutes for task 1, you won't have the full 40 minutes needed for task 2.
- **Make sure you write at least 150 words.** If you don't, your score may be reduced. Aim for 165 words.
- **Don't write too many words.** More words don't necessarily earn more marks. Quality is more important than quantity.
- **Do a plan, don't just start writing.** Spend about 5 minutes analyzing the graph to identify key features and plan how you'll organize your response.
- **Select the important information—don't just write a long list of every point in the graph.** The question specifically asks you to select and explain the key features.
- **Use a mix of sentence types and language—you will be graded on your language skills.** Avoid repetitive patterns like "The number of... increased. The number of... decreased. The number of... stayed the same." This is boring and will not earn you a good score!
- **Don't give your opinions or start to explain why things may have happened.** This is a factual report—just explain what you see.
