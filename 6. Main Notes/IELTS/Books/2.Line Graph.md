> the phrases **"leveled off,"** **"evened out at,"** and **"stabilized at"** are used in line graphs to describe a situation where the data shows **no significant change** over a period of time. This typically corresponds to a **straight horizontal part** of the graph, indicating stability or equilibrium.

#### What These Phrases Show:

1. **Leveled off** :
    
    - Indicates that after an increase or decrease, the values have stopped changing and remained constant *for* a period of time.
    - Example: "The population growth **leveled off** after 2015."
2. **Evened out at** :
    
    - Suggests that fluctuations or variations in the data have smoothed out, resulting in a consistent value.
    - Example: "The unemployment rate **evened out** at 5% *by the end of the* decade."
3. **Stabilized at** :
    
    - Implies that the values have become steady or constant after some initial changes (e.g., increases, decreases, or fluctuations).
    - Example: "The company's profits **stabilized at** $10 million per quarter."

- **Leveled off** : Often implies a gradual transition from change to stability.
- **Evened out at** : Suggests smoothing out of fluctuations to reach a steady state.
- **Stabilized at** : Emphasizes the idea of achieving balance or consistency after some instability.

### Hit a low of, reached a minimum of

- **Example**: The number of arrests **hit a low of** 10 _in_ February.
- **Example**: The number of arrests **reached a minimum of** 5 _in_ January.

### Peaked at, reached a high of

- **Example**: The number of arrests **peaked at** 60 _in_ July.
- **Example**: The number of arrests **reached a high of** 65 _in_ August.
- **Example**: The number of arrests **reached a high of** 65 _during_ August.

## Change Sentences Structure

### Sample Answer:

In **1991**, the number of arrests for illegal drug use stood at **55**. However, **over the following two years**, there was a **sharp fall to 20 per year**. The number then **rose significantly** **from 1995 to 1996** to **50 per year**. **1996 to 1999** saw a **fluctuation in the arrest rate**, which was followed by a **sudden increase** at the end of this period (**with the rate reaching a peak of 80 in 2000**). **Next**, the number of arrests **plunged to a low of 15 in 2001**. It **remained stable** for the following year, but then **increased gradually to 20**, **leveling off at this rate** for the remainder of the period.

Now, take a look at the sentences below, which are all from the graph. There are four different parts: **black (bold)**, **green (capitals)**, **blue (italics)**, and **red (underlined)** (they are also classed as "_bold_," "_capitals_," "_italics_," and "_underlined_" in case you read my notes in black and white printed format in black and white). Each part has a specific function. Read the sentences and determine what you think each different part is doing.

| _Sentence Part_      | _Function?_                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Black (bold)**     | Introduces the sentences, adds coherence, and provides contrast to the paragraph.                                                                     |
| **Green (capitals)** | Tells when something happened.                                                                                                                        |
| **Blue (italics)**   | Describes the changes (what happened to the figures).                                                                                                 |
| **Red (underlined)** | Gives a specific number or value per year, etc., related to the change that has taken place or to the current point in the graph. Shows the movement. |

The phrase **"substantial increase"** generally means a **significant** or **considerable** rise in quantity or value. It does not necessarily imply a **dramatic** or **sudden** increase, nor does it specifically mean an **increase that happens steadily over time**. Instead, it emphasizes the **size** or **importance** of the increase.

- **Substantial Increase**: A large or noticeable rise, but not necessarily sudden or extreme.  
  Example: *"There was a substantial increase in sales, from 100 units to 300 units over the year."*

- **Dramatic Increase**: A very sharp, sudden, or extreme rise.  
  Example: *"There was a dramatic increase in sales, from 100 units to 500 units in just one month."*

- **Increased Steadily**: A gradual and consistent rise over time.  
  Example: **"Sales increased steadily, from 100 units to 300 units over six months."**

- The adverb of **substantial** is **substantially**.

- You can say **"dropped substantially"** or **"fell substantially"** to indicate a significant decrease.

Certainly! Let's start by analyzing the sentence you provided:

> "Energy production from coal in Germany followed a similar pattern, beginning the period at just under 60% and falling significantly, **though unlike Denmark it fell to a low of only 5% in 2007 and then increased again to approximately 18%.**"

### Explanation of "though":
- **Meaning**: In this context, "though" is used as a concessive conjunction. It introduces a contrasting idea that provides additional information or highlights a difference.
- **Grammar**: The clause "though unlike Denmark it fell to a low of only 5% in 2007 and then increased again to approximately 18%" contrasts Germany's energy production trend with Denmark's. While both countries saw a decline in coal-based energy production, Germany's trend differed because it rebounded after hitting a low point.

#### Likewise explanation
The word **"likewise"** is an adverb that has two primary meanings. It is commonly used in both spoken and written English, including in IELTS Writing Task 1, where it can help to show comparisons or similarities between data points. Below, I will explain the two meanings of "likewise," provide grammar notes, and give at least 5 IELTS Task 1 examples for each meaning.

---

##### Meaning 1: "In the same way" or "similarly"
This meaning is used to show that something is done or happens in the same way as something else.

##### Grammar Notes:
- "Likewise" is often used to compare two similar ideas or trends.
- It can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.
- It is often followed by a comma when used at the beginning of a sentence.

###### IELTS Task 1 Examples:
1. **Beginning of sentence:**  
   *"In 2010, 30% of the population used public transport. Likewise, in 2020, the figure remained almost the same at 32%."*

2. **Middle of sentence:**  
   *"The consumption of renewable energy increased significantly in Germany, and likewise in France, it rose by 15%."*

3. **End of sentence:**  
   *"The number of tourists visiting Spain grew by 20% in 2019, and the figure for Italy increased likewise."*

4. **Comparing trends:**  
   *"The sales of electric cars in the UK doubled between 2015 and 2020. Likewise, in Norway, sales saw a similar upward trend."*

5. **Comparing categories:**  
   *"In 2000, 40% of men preferred online shopping, while women, likewise, showed a preference of 38%."*

##### Meaning 2: "Me too" or "the same to you"
This meaning is used to agree with or mirror a statement or action. It is less common in IELTS Task 1 but can still be used in certain contexts.

##### Grammar Notes:
- This usage is more conversational and is often used in responses.
- It is less formal and may not be as suitable for academic writing unless used appropriately.

###### IELTS Task 1 Examples:
1. **Agreeing with a trend:**  
   *"The graph shows a sharp decline in coal usage in 2018. Likewise, the data for oil consumption indicates a similar drop."*

2. **Mirroring a comparison:**  
   *"In 2010, the UK invested heavily in solar energy. Likewise, Germany allocated a significant portion of its budget to renewable sources."*

3. **Responding to a pattern:**  
   *"The number of people cycling to work increased in urban areas. Likewise, rural areas saw a rise in cycling rates."*

4. **Echoing a finding:**  
   *"The proportion of elderly people using the internet grew steadily. Likewise, younger age groups also showed increased usage."*

5. **Reflecting a trend:**  
   *"The demand for organic food rose in 2015. Likewise, the preference for locally sourced products also increased."*

---

##### Key Differences in Usage:
- **Meaning 1** is more common in IELTS Task 1 because it helps to compare data or trends.
- **Meaning 2** is less common but can still be used to show agreement or similarity between data points.

---

##### Tips for Using "Likewise" in IELTS Task 1:
1. Use "likewise" to avoid repetition of words like "similarly" or "in the same way."
2. Ensure that the comparison you are making is clear and logical.
3. Avoid overusing "likewise"; vary your language with other linking words like "similarly," "correspondingly," or "in comparison."
4. Use "likewise" in a formal and academic tone, especially when comparing data.
