## Organizing Your Answer  

### Which Is the Best Way to Write About the Information?  

1. **Write about the chart in 2010, then write about the chart in 2012.**  
   While this approach might seem logical, it makes it difficult for readers to compare changes between the two years. For example, if someone wants to know how nursing enrollments changed, they would need to search through both paragraphs to find the relevant information.  

2. **Write about them together, comparing each course in turn.**  
   This is the better option because it allows for direct comparisons between the two years, making your writing more coherent and easier for the reader to follow.

### What Should I Write About First?  

The most important information typically includes the largest percentages or those that underwent the most significant changes. In this case:  

- **Social Studies:** Initially the most popular course in 2010 (27%), but declined to 21% by 2012.  
- **Nursing:** The second most popular course in 2010 (25.7%), which saw a substantial decline to 14% in 2012.  
- **Sports Science:** Showed the most dramatic change, increasing from 11.9% in 2010 to 25.5% in 2012, becoming the most enrolled course by 2012.  

Courses like **Engineering**, **Psychology**, and **Carpentry** are less interesting because their percentages were smaller and showed only slight changes over the two years.  

---

### What Should I Use for an Overview?  

The overview should highlight the most significant trends or changes observed in the data. Since this pie chart compares data over time, you can focus on the course with the greatest change—in this case, **Sports Science**, whose enrollment increased dramatically.  

For example:  
- "Overall, it can be seen that the greatest change was in the percentage of enrollments for sports science courses, which grew significantly between 2010 and 2012."  

If the pie chart did not involve a time frame, you would instead focus on the largest proportions or notable patterns without discussing changes.  

---

### What Language Should I Use?  

Since this pie chart involves a comparison over time, you will need to use:  
1. **Language of Change:** To describe increases, decreases, or stability.  
2. **Language of Comparison and Contrast:** To highlight differences and similarities between the two years.  

Examples of useful phrases:  
- **Increase/Decrease:** Increased significantly, decreased slightly, remained stable, rose sharply, fell dramatically.  
- **Comparison:** Compared to..., while..., whereas..., similarly..., in contrast..., unlike..., just as....  
- **Proportion:** Represented X% of total enrollments, accounted for Y%, made up Z%.  

Not all pie charts involve a time frame, so always check carefully. If there is no time frame, you will focus solely on comparing proportions rather than describing changes.

## Sample Answer  

The pie charts compare the proportion of enrollments on six different courses at a UK college of education in 2010 and 2012. Overall, it can be seen that the greatest change was in the percentage of enrollments for sports science courses.  

In 2010, social studies was the most popular course, representing just over a quarter (27%) of all enrollments. Although it remained relatively popular, its share dropped to one-fifth (21%) by 2012. Similarly, nursing, which had been the second most popular subject with 25.7% of enrollments in 2010, experienced a significant decline, falling to only 14% two years later. In contrast, sports science, which initially accounted for only 11.9% of enrollments, saw a dramatic increase, rising to become the most popular course in 2012, with 25.5% of total enrollments.  

Less dramatic changes were observed in the remaining three courses. Enrollment in engineering increased slightly, growing from 12.3% in 2010 to 18.5% in 2012. Psychology remained virtually unchanged, maintaining a steady 15.1% in 2010 and 16% in 2012. Likewise, carpentry continued to experience very low levels of enrollment, decreasing further from 8% in 2010 to just 5% in 2012.

## **Pie Chart Language**

Pie charts are a common type of data representation in IELTS Writing Task 1. They always show *percentages* and *proportions*, so it is essential to use the appropriate language when describing them. Below, we will explore the necessary vocabulary, grammar tips, and examples to help you excel in describing pie charts.

### **Key Concepts and Vocabulary**

#### **1. Language of Proportions and Percentages**
Since pie charts represent parts of a whole, you must describe proportions using percentages, fractions, and qualifiers. Here’s how:

| **Percentage** | **Fraction**            | **Qualifier**                | **Proportion/Number**     |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |

#### **3. Grammar Tips for Writing Fractions**
Fractions are commonly used in pie chart descriptions. Here’s how to write them correctly:

- **Numerator**: Use cardinal numbers (one, two, three, etc.).
- **Denominator**: Use ordinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.), except for "half" and "quarter."

| **Fraction** | **Written Form**              | **Example Sentence**                                           |

| 7/100        | seven hundredths              |                                                                |
| 2/102        | two one-hundred-and-secondths |                                                                |
| 1/102        | One one-hundred-second        |                                                                |
The correct form is **"one hundredth"** (without the hyphen) when expressing the fraction **1/100** in written English. 

### Explanation:
- Hyphens are typically used in compound numbers between twenty-one and ninety-nine or when the fraction is used as a compound adjective before a noun.
- When written as a standalone expression of the fraction, it remains unhyphenated.

### Examples:
- **Correct**: One hundredth of the population  
- **Correct**: A one-hundredth share (when used as an adjective)  
- **Incorrect**: One-hundredth of the population  

So, for most cases in IELTS or general writing, use **"one hundredth"**.

### **Examples of Pie Chart Descriptions**

#### Example 1: Pie Chart Over Time
**Prompt:**  
The pie charts compare the proportion of enrollments on six different courses at a UK college of education in 2010 and 2012.

**Response:**  
The pie charts illustrate the distribution of enrollments across six courses at a UK college in 2010 and 2012. Overall, the most significant change occurred in sports science enrollments, which increased dramatically.

In 2010, social studies was the most popular course, accounting for just over a quarter (27%) of all enrollments. By 2012, however, its share had fallen to one-fifth (21%). Similarly, nursing, which initially represented 25.7% of enrollments, experienced a sharp decline to 14%. In contrast, sports science, which started at only 11.9%, saw a remarkable surge, reaching 25.5% by 2012.

The remaining courses showed less dramatic changes. Engineering enrollments rose slightly to 18.5%, while psychology remained relatively stable at 16%. Carpentry, already low at 8% in 2010, dropped further to just 5% in 2012.

The pie charts illustrate the **revenue sources** and ==expenditures== for a children’s charity in the USA in 2016. Overall, it can be seen that **donated food** accounted for the majority of the income, while ==program services== accounted for the most expenditure. Total revenue sources just exceeded outgoings.

In detail, **donated food** provided the largest portion of the revenue for the charity, at **86.6%**. ==Similarly==, with regard to expenditures, one category, ==program services==, accounted for nearly all of the outgoings, at **95.8%**. 

The other categories were much smaller. **Community contributions**, which were the second largest revenue source, brought in **10.4%** of overall income, and this was followed by **program revenue**, at **2.2%**. ==Investment income==, ==government grants==, and ==other income== were very small sources of revenue, accounting for only **0.8%** combined.

There were only two other expenditure items, ==fundraising== and ==management and general==, accounting for **2.6%** and **1.6%** respectively. The total amount of income was **$53,561,580**, which was just enough to cover the expenditures of **$53,224,896**.

### Comments
The response achieves the task because the data from the pie chart is selected and summarized appropriately. Also, it can be seen that comparisons are made, which you are told to do in the rubric. The comparisons are clear from language such as 'similarly', 'much smaller', and 'largest revenue source'. Those are all language of comparison and contrast.

The summary is also well-organized. The writer decides first to compare the two largest items in each pie chart in the first paragraph, then go on to summarize the smaller items of expenditure, each in a separate paragraph.

It is therefore easy to follow the description.

There is not one right way to organize the pie chart. You could, for example, discuss each chart in turn as they are about different categories.

### Improved Model Answer

The four pie charts compare the electricity generated between Germany and France during 2009, measured in billions kWh. Overall, it can be seen that **conventional thermal** was the main source of electricity in Germany, whereas ==nuclear== was the primary source in France.

The bulk of electricity in Germany, with a total output of **560 billion kWh**, came from **conventional thermal**, at **59.6%**. In contrast, France's total output was lower, at **510 billion kWh**, and conventional thermal accounted for just **10.3%**. Instead, most electricity in France came from ==nuclear power== (76%). In Germany, the proportion of nuclear power generated electricity was only one-fifth of the total.

Moving on to renewables, this accounted for quite similar proportions for both countries, ranging from around **14%** to **17%** of the total electricity generated. In detail, in Germany, most of the renewables consisted of **wind** and **biomass**, totaling around **75%**, which was far higher than for ==hydroelectric== (**17.7%**) and ==solar== (**6.1%**). The situation was very different in France, where ==hydroelectric== made up **80.5%** of renewable electricity, with biomass, wind, and solar making up the remaining **20%**. Neither country used ==geothermal energy==.

### Comments
In order to make the answer clear, the writer has organized the chart by categories and types of energy.

So the first body paragraph compares 'All Types' for both countries and examines each energy type in turn, before moving on to 'Renewables' and doing the same thing. This makes it easy to read and follow, meaning that it will get a good score for its cohesion and coherence, but also for Task Response as this method means there is plenty of comparison between the countries and energy types.
