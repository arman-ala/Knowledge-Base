## **Introduction Structure**

There are two parts to the introduction:

1) **What the graph shows**  
2) **The overview**

### **1) What the graph shows**
This part should answer the following questions:
1. What is the type of graph shown?  
2. What is the data being presented?  
3. What are the units of measurement?  
4. Is there a period of time?

This can be addressed by paraphrasing the title of the graph and incorporating information from the x-axis (time period) and y-axis (units of measurement). For example, the title of the graph has been transformed into the first line of the introduction below:

**Introduction Example:**  
The line graph illustrates changes in the levels of coffee exports in three South American countries from 2002 to 2012 and is measured in millions of kilograms.  

**Note:** You must not copy the title or significant parts of it directly; instead, paraphrase it. Keeping some words the same or changing the order of the words is acceptable.

#### **Language Tips for "What the Graph Shows"**
1. **Tense:** Use the present simple tense to describe what the graph shows.  
2. **Phrases:** Use introductory phrases such as:  
   - The graph ==shows==…  
   - The graph ==illustrates==…  
   - The graph ==compares==…  
   - The graph ==gives information about==…
   - The graph ==depicts==…
   - The graph ==outlines==…
   - The graph ==presents==…
   - The graph ==provides information on==…
   - The graph ==demonstrates==…
   - The graph ==reveals==…
   - The graph ==highlights==…
   - The graph ==examines==…
   - The graph ==analyzes==…

   - The graph explores…
   - The graph indicates…
   - The graph reports…

## 2) **The overview***

The second part of the introduction provides an **overview** of the main trends or patterns in the data. This should summarize the key points without going into too much detail. For example:

**Overview Example:**  
Overall, it can be seen that, despite some fluctuations, over the period as a whole, the levels of exports rose in all three countries.

### **Detailed Description**

*The line graph illustrates changes in the levels of coffee exports in three South American countries from 2002 to 2012 and is measured in millions of kilograms.* **Overall, it can be seen that, despite some fluctuations, over the period as a whole, the levels of exports rose in all three countries.**

- **Brazil and Costa Rica:**  
  Brazil and Costa Rica started at a fairly similar level of between 12 and 15 million kilograms in 2002. While the coffee exported from Brazil increased gradually over the following four years, exports from Costa Rica experienced a significant fall to around 7.5 million. However, both countries then followed a similar trend, with exports increasing steadily to 20 million for Costa Rica and 25 million for Brazil by the end of the period.

- **Colombia:**  
  Colombia had a more erratic pattern of exports compared to the other two countries. Exports stood at 5 million kilograms per year in 2002, which was lower than Costa Rica or Brazil. They overtook Costa Rica in 2006, with exports reaching 12 million, but there was then a sharp fall to 2008, when exports hit a low of 2.5 million. Following this, exports increased rapidly, finishing the period at 15 million.

**Note:** When writing an overview for Task 1, it's essential to identify one or two main trends or patterns. Think of the graph as a visual representation rather than just numbers. Focus on the significant occurrences depicted in the data. For instance, in the graph illustrating coffee exports, you can observe that all exports have increased over the given period. If there were variations, such as two categories increasing while one decreased, make sure to highlight these contrasting trends.
Typically, one or two key pieces of data will stand out. According to the IELTS public band descriptors, including an overview is crucial for achieving a Band 6 or higher in "task response." Therefore, it's vital not to overlook this component.


**Note:** The introduction should focus on overall trends rather than specific numerical data. Providing detailed figures might detract from the overview's purpose. Sometimes, the overview is included as a conclusion at the end of the essay. Both placements are acceptable; however, if you find yourself short on words or time, you can rephrase the overview statement and place it at the end. Nonetheless, a separate conclusion is not mandatory for Task 1.

It is advisable for students to position the overview at the beginning of their response. This ensures that even if you run out of time and fail to include an overview at the end, you still meet the criteria for a Band 6 or higher in "task response."

### **Language Tips**

#### a) Tense:

Utilize the active voice and the past simple tense when describing completed past events. This helps maintain clarity and coherence in your writing.
