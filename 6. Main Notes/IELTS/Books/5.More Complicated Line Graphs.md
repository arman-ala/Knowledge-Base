**Analysis of Energy Production from Coal (1995-2010)**
==The line graph illustrates== ==the production of energy from coal== in ==Sweden, France, Denmark, and Germany== ==from 1995 to 2010==. Overall, the percentage of energy generated from coal decreased in all four countries during this period.

Denmark and Germany experienced a significant decline in coal-based energy production. In 1995, Denmark's energy production from coal was 60%, the highest among the four countries. However, this figure dropped sharply over the next 15 years, reaching just 10% in 2010, the lowest percentage that year. Germany followed a similar trend, starting at just under 60% in 1995 and declining significantly. Unlike Denmark, Germany's production hit a low of 5% in 2007 before slightly increasing to approximately 18% by 2010.

In contrast, Sweden and France saw more moderate declines. In Sweden, 35% of energy came from coal in 1995, gradually decreasing to around 28% by 2010, the highest among the four countries that year. France's coal-based energy production remained just below Sweden's levels throughout the 15-year period.

**Why This is a Good Answer**

This response is effective due to the following elements:

1. **Introduction**: The graph is introduced with all key details without directly copying the rubric.

2. **Overview**: The response provides a clear summary of the main trends.
   
   *Overall, the percentage of energy produced from coal declined in all four countries over the timeframe.*

   Note: This overview could alternatively be placed as a conclusion.

3. **Mix of Complex Sentences**: The response includes a variety of sentence structures.
   
   - "...higher than the other four countries" (reduced relative clause)
   - "...which was the lowest of that year" (relative clause)
   - "...though unlike Denmark it fell to a low of only 5% in 2007" (adverbial clause)
   - "...the highest of the four countries" (reduced relative clause)
   - "...while the percentage produced in France remained..." (adverbial clause)

4. **Appropriate Language of Change**

The graph employs appropriate *language of change* and not only describes the changes but also compares the information:

*The line graph compares the production of energy from coal in Sweden, France, Denmark, and Germany between 1995 and 2010. Overall, the percentage of energy produced from coal declined in all four countries over the timeframe.*

*There was a dramatic fall in the production in Denmark and Germany. Denmark’s production of energy from coal stood at 60% in 1995, higher than the other four countries. However, production levels dropped sharply over the next 15 years to finish at 10% in 2010, which was the lowest of that year. Energy production from coal in Germany followed a similar pattern, beginning the period at just under 60% and falling significantly, though unlike Denmark, it fell to a low of only 5% in 2007 and then increased again to approximately 18%.*

*In contrast, Sweden and France saw more moderate falls(more info: [[2.Line Graph#**Moderate Fall**]]) over the period. 35% of energy came from coal in Sweden in 1995, and this proportion gradually declined over the period to finish at approximately 28% in 2010, the highest of the four countries, while the percentage produced in France remained just under that of Sweden over the 15-year period.*

5. **Mix of Language of Change**

There is also a mix in the language of change used. A variety is essential:

- *declined*
- *dramatic fall*
- *stood at*
- *dropped sharply*
- *falling significantly*
- *fell to a low of*
- *increased*
- *moderate falls*
- *gradually declined*
- *remained just under*

---

6. **Variety of Sentence Types**

There is a variety of sentence types discussing the graph. Using a limited number of sentence structures can result in a low score. This graph includes a mixture of grammatical structures. For example:

- *There was a dramatic fall in the production in Denmark and Germany*  
  (There + be + adjective + noun + in + noun)

- *Production levels dropped sharply over the next 15 years to finish at 10% in 2010*  
  (Noun + verb + adverb)

- *France saw more moderate falls over the period*  
  (Time/country + saw/experienced/witnessed + adjective + noun + in + noun)

---

7. **Good Organization**

The graph is well-organized. The information is grouped logically, demonstrating that the writer has analyzed the graph and understood the trends:

- *Body paragraph one = Germany and Denmark*
- *Body paragraph two = Sweden and France*

Topic sentences (without data) that convey the main idea of the paragraphs also contribute to a well-organized and clear answer:

- Topic sentence 1: *There was a dramatic fall in the production in Denmark and Germany.*
- Topic sentence 2: *In contrast, Sweden and France saw more moderate falls over the period.*

---

8. **Appropriate Data Selection**

There are no mistakes in the data selected from the graph. Additionally, all important data is chosen and compared. It is not necessary to describe every point or change in the graph, especially if it is complex. Instead, focus on identifying key points. For example, the change in Denmark is described in two sentences. The writer only needed to identify where it began (60%) and where it ended (10%) because it mostly declines steadily with minor fluctuations:

*Denmark’s production of energy from coal stood at 60% in 1995, higher than the other four countries. However, production levels dropped sharply over the next 15 years to finish at 10% in 2010, which was the lowest of that year.*

Including more data would be excessive. The data from Germany is described in one sentence:

*Energy production from coal in Germany followed a similar pattern, beginning the period at just under 60% and falling significantly, though unlike Denmark, it fell to a low of only 5% in 2007 and then increased again to approximately 18%.*

9. **Accurate Grammar**

There are no grammar errors in the response. While it may be challenging for non-native English writers to achieve perfect accuracy, the more precise your grammar, the better. The correct tense (past simple) is used throughout, as the graph represents a completed period in the past.
