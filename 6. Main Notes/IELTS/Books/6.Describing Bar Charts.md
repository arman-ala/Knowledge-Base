## Bar Chart Analysis

![[6_bar-chart.png]]

The bar chart illustrates the average number of hours per week that men and women spend on various activities around the home.

As discussed in Units 4 and 5, to write a well-organized and structured response for Task 1, you should consider how to group the information. This grouping will form the paragraphs of your Task 1 response. It is essential to show how elements relate to each other by comparing and contrasting.

When analyzing the chart on the average number of hours spent on activities around the home, consider the following questions before writing:

- **What is the graph about?**  
  It compares the number of hours that men and women spend on different activities around the home.

### Time Frame and Grouping

- **Is there a time frame?**  
  No, there is no timeframe. This means you cannot use the language of change. Instead, focus on comparing and contrasting. Additionally, since no specific date is provided (e.g., survey results from 2010), you should use the present simple tense.

- **How could the information be grouped?**  
  This is a crucial step, as it helps you provide an overview of the main points. Refer back to Unit 4 for guidance on grouping information.

Now, reconsider the bar chart on men and women's activities around the home. How would you group the information? Here are several possible approaches:

1. **Grouping by Gender:**  
   - Activities in which men spend more time than women.  
   - Activities in which women spend more time than men.

2. **Grouping by Activity Type:**  
   - Activities where both men and women spend more time.  
   - Activities where both men and women spend less time.

3. **Grouping by Men and Women:**  
   You could write one paragraph about men and another about women. However, this approach has a disadvantage: readers would need to frequently switch between paragraphs to compare activities. For example, cooking for men would be in one paragraph, and cooking for women in another, making it harder to see differences at a glance.

4. **Grouping by Activities:**  
   a) **Type of Activity:**  
   Often, you can group elements into smaller subgroups. For instance, activities can be divided into leisure activities and household chores. 'Chores' are tasks or duties that need to be done, often viewed as burdensome rather than enjoyable (though this is subjective).

   Hereâ€™s how you could organize the information:

| **Paragraph 1: Household Chores** | **Paragraph 2: Leisure Activities** |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cooking                           | Reading                            |
| Cleaning the house                | Gardening*                        |
| Washing up                        | Surfing the internet              |
|                                   | Watching TV                       |

   *Gardening could be seen as a chore, but in many countries, it is viewed as an enjoyable hobby.

   This method is effective because it clearly divides activities and highlights patterns: women spend more time on chores, while men spend more time on leisure activities.

   b) **By Pattern of Activity:**  
   Another approach is to group activities based on patterns. For example, you could discuss activities where men spend more time than women and vice versa.

| **Paragraph 1: Men Spend More Time Than Women** | **Paragraph 2: Women Spend More Time Than Men** |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Gardening                                        | Cooking                                         |
| Surfing the Internet                             | Cleaning the house                              |
| Watching Television                              | Washing up                                      |
|                                                  | Reading                                         |

5. **Grouping Information by Significant Differences**

Another approach is to discuss groups with significant differences first, followed by those with more similarities:

| **Paragraph 1: Big Differences Between the Sexes** | **Paragraph 2: Similarities Between the Sexes** |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| - Cooking                                           | - Washing up                                     |
| - Cleaning the house                                | - Reading                                        |
| - Surfing the Internet                              | - Gardening                                      |
|                                                     | - Watching Television                            |

There is no definitive "right" or "wrong" way to group the information. Different individuals may group it differently, yet both approaches could result in effective answers. The key is to ensure that the grouping is logical, easy to follow, and clearly presented. Therefore, it is essential to spend a few minutes analyzing the graph before writing to identify:

1. What patterns or trends stand out?
2. What groupings would make your answer the clearest and simplest to write?

### Language of Comparison and Contrast

Since the graph does not involve changes over time, your focus should be on using the language of comparison and contrast.

| **Example Word** | **Comparative**       | **Superlative**          |
|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| high             | higher                 | the highest              |
| productive       | more productive       | the most productive      |
| less productive  | less productive       | the least productive     |
| wealthy          | wealthier             | the wealthiest           |
| hot              | hotter                | the hottest              |
| good             | better                 | the best                 |

### Other Important Language Structures

Comparatives and superlatives are useful, but additional language structures are necessary for effective comparison and contrast.

**Subordinating Conjunctions:**
1. The UAE produces high levels of gas, whereas/while Japan produces none.
2. Whereas/While the UAE produces high levels of gas, Japan produces none.
3. Although the UAE produced almost 36 million tonnes of gas, Japan produced none.

**Other Structures:**
1. Developing countries are more reliant on alternative energy production than developed countries.
2. Solar power accounts for far less of the total energy production than gas or coal does.
3. Hydropower is not as efficient as wind power.
4. The Middle East produces twice as much oil as Europe.
5. Western countries consume three times more oil than the Middle East.
6. Russia consumes slightly more oil than Germany.

### Sample Answer

Here is a sample answer for the activities graph, organized by the type of activity, with paragraphs divided into "chores" and "leisure activities":

*The bar chart illustrates the average hours that men and women spend per week on various activities around their homes. At first glance, it is evident that, with the exception of reading, women spend more time on household chores than men, while men spend more time on leisure activities.*

*Regarding household chores, women spend the most time on cooking, at 15 hours per week, compared to approximately 9 hours for men. Women also spend more than double the amount of time cleaning the house than men, though this chore consumes less time than others for both sexes. Similarly, washing up is predominantly a task undertaken by women rather than men, at 7 and 5 hours, respectively.*

*Turning to leisure activities, the most popular is watching television, with slightly more men than women partaking in this activity on a weekly basis. Interestingly, men spend nearly three times more time than women surfing the Internet. The hours spent on reading are fairly similar for males and females, at around 5 hours per week. Gardening accounts for just a few hours per week for both sexes.*

**Summary**

When analyzing bar charts, follow the same steps as with line graphs. However, always check whether the graph involves changes over time. Line charts always involve time, while some bar charts do, and others do not. For bar charts over time, you can follow the same approach as with line graphs. 

Additionally, ensure that your analysis includes a clear grouping strategy, appropriate use of comparative and contrastive language, and a well-structured overview to maximize coherence and clarity in your response.
