### What does it mean?

This is often one of the most confusing aspects of the test.

It is essential that you know the word limit for each question and stick to it.

Here are some examples:

- **'NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS'** means that you may write one OR two words, but no more.
- **'NOT MORE THAN ONE WORD AND/OR A NUMBER'** means that if you write more than one word, your answer will be incorrect.
- **'NOT MORE THAN ONE WORD AND/OR A NUMBER'** means that you can write:
  - One word
  - One number
  - One word and a number
