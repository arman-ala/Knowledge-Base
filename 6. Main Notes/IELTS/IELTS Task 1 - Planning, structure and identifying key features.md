topics going to be covered in this section are:
- Why we should plan
- How to plan
- Simple four paragraph structure
- Identifying key features
- Examples
- Key lessons
In the last module we learnt how to understand and analyze graphs, charts and tables.

## Why plan?
Most people spend about 30 minutes on the IELTS Task 1 which is a bad behavior. You should at most, spend 20 minutes on the first task.
Students think that planning will cost a huge amount of time and energy, so they do not do that which is again, a super bas behavior.
Planning Pros:
- It saves you time.
- If you know what to write, writing will be quick.
- Task 1 is a thinking task and a writing task. If we plan, we can make them separated and our writing would be done sooner.
- You will make fewer mistakes.
- You won't get stuck because of the lack of time.

## Four stages of Planning
1. Understand the graph (covered in last module)
	1. What type of graph is it?
	2. What does the title say?
	3. What does it say on x and y axes?
	4. What is measurement
	5. What are the items and is there a key?
	6. How many items are there?
	7. Is it over time or not?
	8. What tenses will you have to use?
	9. What is the purpose?
2. Identifying key features (will be covered in this module)
3. Identify any comparisons.
4. Add information to a structure.

### Structure
The question always states the same thing:
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant."</mark>
Therefore, we can use the same structure for every question.
In this structure, each item represents a paragraph:
1. Introduction (next module)
2. Overview (next module)
3. Details 1 (after next module)
4. Details 2 (after next module)

The red box is always the same but on the other hand, the blue box varies from exam to exam.
The blue box's sentence is the one which we paraphrase and write down as **Introduction**, More details will be provided in the next chapter.
For **Overview** paragraph we will pick **2-4 key features** and report them generally without providing data.

To write an overview you only need the starting point and ending one.

### Identifying Key Features
- The biggest mistake students make is **overcomplicating these**.
- They are often the most obvious things.
- The examiner knows that you have never seen the graph before and that you are not expert in this field.
- - The biggest mistake teachers make is simply telling students to look out for things like:
	- Biggest
	- Smallest
	- Big changes
	- Big differences
	- Trends
	- Comparison
- Problem with this is that it does not allow any flexibility and treats all graphs the same.

### Examples
![[IELTS Task 1 Question Example 2.png]]
It is a bar chart over time so it shows tends over time. We just need to trace it from start to end.

![[IELTS Task 1 Question Example 3.png]]
In this example, we have 2 general trends:
- A significant rise in the percentage of the population that owned a computer.
- The higher the level of education, the more likely they are to own a computer.

First thing you notice is that this graph is over time, but it's not years, months or weeks, it is time of day or night (from 6 a.m. to next one).
We can provide 3 key features:
- Watching TV has the highest percentage in evening.
- Listening to radio reaches the highest in morning.
- Overall, more people watch TV.
![[IELTS Task 1 Question Example 5.png]]We notice it is over time, so it shows trends over time.
Our 3 general trends will be:
- Overall, the number of men and women in full time education increased.
- Women in part time education increased significantly
- Men in part time education fluctuated.
![[IELTS Task 1 Question Example 6.png]]
In this example, it is obvious that the examiner wants us to compare Yemen to Italy and compare 2000 to 2050:
- It is clear that Yemen had the younger population in the year 2000, and the same is predicted for the year 2050.
- The populations of both countries are predicted to get older over 50 year period.
One of the mistakes you may make is that you comment on each group of ages.
For instance you should not say "half of the people in Yemen were 0 to 14 but it is predicted to be reduced by 13 percentage by 2050."

- Coffee increased in all five countries from 1999 to 2004.
- Sales of bananas only went up in three out of the five countries.

## Key Lessons
1. Don't get into detail
2. Look for the most obvious thing
3. If more than 4 elements are presented, then it is probably wrong
4. Look at the big picture
5. Don't overcomplicate it. If it seems easy or obvious then you have the right answer.
6. If it is over time, look for general trends
7. Think about the purpose
