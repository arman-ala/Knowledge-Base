### Introduction
Paraphrase: The line chart below displays the use of power from sun in the USA, Germany, Japan and China.

### Overview
Overall, America and China's use of solar power increased significantly over the entire period. Japan's use decreased gradually and Germany's remained relatively stable.

### Details 1
The United States was the biggest consumer of solar energy in 1995 with just below 8,000 and increased consistently every year to around 18,000 in 2015. China was the lowest overall user at the start of the period at around 1000, but steadily increased to just over 2000 over the next 10 years, before increasing consumption dramatically to become the second highest consumer with nearly 12,000 in 2015.

### Details 2
Japan's use began the recorded period with around 6,000 and this consistently dropped year on year to just below 4,000 in 2015. Germany's value hovered between approximately 2,000 and 3,000 throughout the entire period.

### approximation phrases and words
In IELTS Writing Task 1, showing approximation is important when describing data, trends, or quantities that are not exact but close to a certain value. Using a variety of phrases to indicate approximation makes your writing more precise and natural. Below is a detailed list of phrases and words commonly used to show approximation, along with explanations and examples for each.

---
1. Just over / Just above

Meaning: Slightly more than a particular number or amount.

Use: When the value is a little higher than a specific figure.

Example:  

• "The number of visitors was just over 5,000 last month."  

• "The unemployment rate rose to just above 7% in 2023."

Explanation: This phrase implies a small margin above the stated number, often less than 5%.

---
2. Just below / Just under

Meaning: Slightly less than a particular number or amount.

Use: When the value is a little lower than a specific figure.

Example:  

• "Sales figures were just below 10,000 units in June."  

• "The average temperature was just under 20 degrees Celsius."

Explanation: It indicates a value close to but not reaching the given figure.

---
3. Nearly / Almost

Meaning: Very close to a number but not quite reaching it.

Use: To express that something is close to, but less than, a certain amount or degree.

Example:  

• "Nearly 60% of respondents preferred option A."  

• "Almost 1 million cars were sold last year."

Explanation: These words emphasize closeness to the target number, often used for percentages or quantities.

---
4. Around / About / Approximately

Meaning: Roughly or close to a certain number or amount; an estimate.

Use: When the exact figure is unknown or unnecessary, but an approximate value is given.

Example:  

• "Around 30 students attended the lecture."  

• "The city’s population is about 2 million."  

• "Approximately 15% of the budget was allocated to marketing."

Explanation: These are neutral approximations and are commonly used when precise data is unavailable or irrelevant.

---
5. Close to

Meaning: Near in value or quantity to a specific number.

Use: To indicate proximity to a figure, either slightly less or more.

Example:  

• "The company's profits were close to $1 billion last year."  

• "Close to half of the participants were under 30."

Explanation: Suggests near equality without specifying if it’s above or below.

---
6. More or less

Meaning: Approximately; roughly.

Use: To suggest an estimate that may vary slightly either way.

Example:  

• "More or less 100 people attended the seminar."  

• "The project took more or less six months to complete."

Explanation: Informal approximation indicating some uncertainty about the exact figure.

---
7. Just about

Meaning: Almost exactly; very close to a number.

Use: To emphasize something is nearly at a certain point.

Example:  

• "Just about 75% of the students passed the exam."  

• "The temperature was just about freezing."

Explanation: Similar to “nearly” or “almost,” but can imply slightly more precision.

---
8. Slightly / A little / A bit

Meaning: A small degree more or less than a certain value.

Use: To show small differences from an exact figure.

Example:  

• "Sales increased by slightly more than 5%."  

• "The population decreased by a little over 2,000 people."  

• "The price dropped by a bit under $10."

Explanation: These phrases highlight minor deviations from the stated number.

---
9. Roughly

Meaning: Approximately; without exact detail.

Use: When giving an estimate that may not be precise.

Example:  

• "Roughly 40% of respondents favored option B."  

• "The journey took roughly three hours."

Explanation: Often used in informal contexts but acceptable in IELTS writing when precision isn’t critical.

---
10. In the region of / In the range of

Meaning: Within a certain approximate area or range of values.

Use: To describe figures that fall within a general bracket.

Example:  

• "The cost is in the region of $500."  

• "The temperature varied in the range of 15 to 20 degrees Celsius."

Explanation: Useful for describing data that fluctuates within limits.

---
11. Just shy of

Meaning: Slightly less than a particular number.

Use: When the value is just under a certain figure, often with an implication of being close but not reaching it.

Example:  

• "The attendance was just shy of 1,000 people."  

• "Profits were just shy of $10 million last quarter."

Explanation: More informal but effective in showing close approximation from below.

Tips for IELTS Writing Task 1:

• Use these phrases to avoid repeating “about” or “approximately” too often.

• Choose phrases based on context—whether you want to emphasize closeness, slight excess, or slight deficiency.

• Combine approximate phrases with numbers and percentages for clarity.

• Avoid exaggeration; keep approximations reasonable and consistent with data shown.

---

Notes on Usage:

• For fractions less than one, use phrases like *one fifth*, *one quarter*, *half*, etc., or percentages such as *20%* or *50%*.

• For multiples greater than one, use *twice*, *triple*, *quadruple*, or the *number + times* construction.

• *X-fold* (e.g., sixfold, sevenfold) is a formal way to say “times” and is common in academic writing.

• *Double* and *twice* are synonymous; *double* can be used as adjective or verb, while *twice* is an adverb.

• *Quintuple* and above are less common but still correct; often “five times,” “six times,” etc., are preferred for clarity.

---

Additional Example Sentences Using These Phrases:

• Twice / Double:  

  • "The revenue this year is twice as much as last year’s figure."  

  • "Their profits doubled compared to the previous quarter."

• Triple / Three Times:  

  • "This year’s sales were triple those recorded last year."  

  • "Attendance was three times that of the event held in 2019."

• Quadruple / Four Times:  

  • "Exports quadrupled over the last decade."  

  • "Production levels are four times higher than five years ago."

• Five Times / Quintuple:

  • "Profit margins grew sevenfold during the expansion period."

• Ten Times / Tenfold:  

  • "Sales increased ten times following the advertising campaign."  

  • "The company’s valuation rose tenfold within three years."
