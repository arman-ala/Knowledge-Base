## Task 2 Format
Every question has the same format:
- You will be given a statement on a common topic.
- You will be asked to respond to that statement.
	- There are 5 different ways you might be asked to respond.

## Task 2 Requirements
- Write at least 250 words.
- Provide relevant ideas and support these ideas with explanations and examples.
- Use a formal and academic style.

It's a better way to get the Task 2 before task one because it is worth twice as much as Task 1 is worth.
It must be done in 40 minutes.
