  - The reading and listening tests are as much vocabulary tests as they are skills tests. It is much easier to get a good score when you have a wide-ranging vocabulary.

- **Read and Listen (Step 1)**
  - Studies have shown that the number one way for learners to improve their vocabulary is through reading and listening to genuine sources of English.

- **Record (Step 2)**

- **Review (Step 3)**
