This module is about:
- Why introductions and overviews are important
- How to paraphrase
- How to write an effective overview
## Review Structure
1. Introduction - 1 sentence
2. Overview - 2 sentences
3. Details 1 - 3-4 sentences
4. Details 2 - 3-4 sentences
## Introductions
- These are very easy to write and should be one sentence only.
- They are easy to write because all you have to do is paraphrase the question statement.
- Paraphrasing means writing something again with different words, but with the same meaning.
	- We can do this in several ways:
		- Synonyms
			- There are two types of synonyms:
				- Direct: lady/woman
				- Loose: phone/gadget
				- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">We should NOT use LOOSE type</mark>
		- Different word forms
			- There are four main types of word form:
				- Verbs (avoid)
				- Nouns (avoidance)
				- Adjectives (avoidable)
				- Adverbs (avoidably)
			- We can also change the tense (However, this often changes the grammar, so be careful)
		- Examples: Britain -> England, Wales and Scotland

## Overviews
- The most important part of our whole task 1 essay.
- Band 6 - presents an overview with information appropriately selected.
- Band 7 - presents a clear overview of main trends, differences or stages (process diagrams).
- Identify **2-4 key features** and write them in a separate paragraph. Does not matter where you put it.
- It must be two sentences only.
- No data or details must be included.
### Identify Main Features
- It is the most obvious thing. Look at the big picture.
- Think about purpose:
	- If over time, it will be a general trend.
	- If not over time, more likely to be biggest/smallest and comparisons.
- Treat each paragraph differently.
