In this module we will:
- Identify key features of data sources
- Use key features to understand data
- Identify purpose of data sources
First we are going to look at line or bar graphs
## Line Graph

There are 5 features of any line or bar graph:
- 
- 
- 
- (sometimes one of them is missing and sometimes both of them are not given)
- 
## Pie chart
There are 3 main features:
- Title
- Key or Label
- Unit of measurement (normally %)

## Table

There are 4 main features:
- Title
- Columns
- Rows
- Units of measurement

### Step 1: Understanding IELTS Academic Task 1
IELTS Academic Task 1 requires you to describe visual data, such as graphs, charts, or tables, in at least 150 words. Your response must be formal, objective, and structured. The goal is to summarize the information, highlight key trends, and make comparisons where relevant, without giving personal opinions or speculative reasons for the data.

You should aim to:
- Paraphrase the task description in your introduction.
- Provide an overview of the main trends or features.
- Describe the data in detail, focusing on significant changes, comparisons, and patterns.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Data Sources
You have provided three data sources: a line graph, two pie charts, and a table. Let us break down each one and map their features to the descriptions you provided.

#### Line Graph: Percentage of Total Music Sales by Method (2011â€“2018)
![[IELTS Taks1 line graph example.png]]
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Title</mark>: "Percentage of total music sales by method"
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">X-axis (horizontal)</mark>: Years (2011 to 2018)
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Y-axis (vertical)</mark>: Percentage (0% to 60%)
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Units of measurement</mark> : Percentage (%)
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Key</mark>: Streams (blue dashed line), Downloads (red solid line), CDs purchased (green dotted line)

**Observation**: The graph shows the percentage of music sales through three methods over an 8-year period. Streams increase steadily, downloads peak around 2014 and then decline, while CDs purchased show a consistent downward trend.

Bar graph and Line graph is so similar to each other.

#### Pie Charts: Device Usage in 2009 and 2019
![[IELTS Task 1 Pie Chart Example.png]]
- **Title**: Implied as device usage in 2009 and 2019 (not explicitly stated)
- **Key/Label**: Mobile phone, Laptop, Tablet, Desktop computer, Flat-screen TV, Conventional TV
- **Unit of measurement**: Percentage (%)

**Observation**: The pie charts compare device usage over a decade. In 2009, conventional TVs dominate at 34%, while by 2019, mobile phones take the lead at 26%, and conventional TVs drop to 15%.

#### Table: Sales of Fairtrade-Labelled Coffee and Bananas (1999 & 2004)
![[IELTS Task 1 Table Example.png]]
- **Title**: "Sales of Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas (1999 & 2004)"
- **Columns**: 1999 sales, 2004 sales (for both coffee and bananas)
- **Rows**: Countries (UK, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden)
- **Units of measurement**: Millions of euros

**Observation**: The table shows sales growth in most countries. For coffee, the UK sees the largest increase (1.5 to 20 million euros). For bananas, the UK again shows the biggest rise (15 to 47 million euros), while Sweden sees a decline (2 to 0.9 million euros).

### Purpose of Graphs, Charts and Tables

- It is important to understand the data, but is even more important to know the purpose.
- All graphs and charts display data, however, there will normally be more data than required.
- We therefore have to identify key features of the data. Purpose helps us do that.
There are only two possible purposes for Graphs, Charts and Tables:
- Show trends over time.
	- You can always tell if it is "Trends over time" by easily looking at your Y-axis or X-axis. If one of them was representing time, you can say the purpose is "Trends over time".
	- They want you to describe the graph by only comparing the start point with end point and with no details.
- Compare and contrast data.
	- When there is no dates, it is all about "Compare and Contrast".
