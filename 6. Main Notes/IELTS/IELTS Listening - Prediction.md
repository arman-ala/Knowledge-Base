Prediction is the most tested of the listening sub-skills, and crucially important to getting a high score in the test.

Predicting enables you not only to focus your brain on the part that you will hear, but more importantly, not focus on any other areas.

**For example:**

- Name: Shaun Rodgers  
- Room no.: _______  
- Number of occupants: 1  
- Check out time: _______

In this example, we can accurately predict that we are going to hear a room number and time. That means we can completely focus on those two items, making it much easier for us to get the correct answer.

## How to Predict

In the IELTS listening test, there will be between 30â€“45 seconds of silence before the section of the recording begins. Use this time wisely by predicting what you are going to hear.

You should think about the following:

- **Grammar:** noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc. Often it will be obvious which word form we need to use. If we use a different form of the word, we will get the question wrong.
- **Subject:** phone number, address, date, business name, etc. This will help us focus on the correct part of the recording and find the correct information more easily.
- **Function:** list, question, label, instruction, etc.
