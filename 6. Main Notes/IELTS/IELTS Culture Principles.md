1. Keep it simple
>	IELTS is a very simple test complicated by students and teachers.
>	The key to success is understanding that IELTS is a test of clear communication. It is not a test of how much fancy stuff you can learn. Most of the courses try to teach such things and that's the reason behind their failure in helping students succeed.
>	We have to unlearn everything we have been taught.
>	Remember that more complexity is not equal to higher IELTS score.
2. Humility
>	Humility means that you are constantly looking to improve. Think of someone who is not humble, who is very arrogant , they will not improve unless they remove their ego.
>	If you want to overcome a problem, you have to learn how to improve and stay humble.
>	Each student should take responsibility for their performance and results. They should not blame external factors for things that are within their control. 
>	<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You are the only person who can be blamed for your poor performance.</mark>
3. Honesty
>	To understand the world accurately, you should be honest with yourself.
>	If you are not honest, you are not able to live in reality.
4. Focus
>	everything in this course is focused on your success. In order to gain success, we must find out the exact reasons why you are not able to get the score you need yet. Once the reason is undisguised, we will totally focus on those weakness.
5. Mindset
>	Mindset is more important than ability, English level, strategy, technique, or skill. In other word, it's your attitude, how you think about things.
>	The keys to a good mindset are simplicity, humility, honesty, focus, discipline and courage.
6. Courage
>	We are here to understand our weaknesses and work hard to improve.
>	Doing new things is not easy and needs courage.
>	Nothing worthy ever in the entire history of the world was ever achieved without taking action. This takes courage.
7. Systems
>	You need a step-by-step guide to achieve the score you want.
>	the system is not suggesting you, it give **directions** and you should do whatever they demand.
8. Win/Win
>	Most courses leave you at the moment you buy their course and they don't care about your score or success.
>	In this course, your failure is equal to our failure
9. Discipline
>	All the information you need is here and you have access to them but the lack of discipline won't allow you to use them and improve.
>	Discipline is all about taking the action as planned.
10. Cover and Move
>	This is from military. When a soldier wants to move another soldier starts to shoot, and after reaching the point, the other one will cover ex-shooter soldier in order for him to move to the point. 
>	This is what should we do, Team work!
