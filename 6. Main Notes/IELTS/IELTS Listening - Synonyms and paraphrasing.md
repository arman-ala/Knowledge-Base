### **Synonyms and Paraphrasing**

You should always be aware of how synonyms and paraphrasing are used.

In the IELTS listening test, it is normal for you to read one word but hear another word with the same meaning. For example, you may read "cost" but hear "price." This is called a synonym, and the IELTS listening test has lots of them.

A common mistake is to read a certain word and try to listen for that word, but then not hear it. That is because the recording used a synonym. For example, you might hear someone making a hotel reservation and you have to note down their details.

The form might say "Arrival Date," but you will hear "day you arrive." Similarly, you may read "Departure Date," but you might hear "day you leave."

Make sure you think about the type of information you might hear in the form of synonyms, not just what you read.

### **Synonyms and Paraphrasing Practice**

Practicing this skill allows you to improve your listening and vocabulary at the same time.

A good listening resource to help you improve your vocabulary while listening is FluentU. This website has a huge range of English videos and bilingual subtitles for most of them. It also has a "hover-over" dictionary for any words you don't know. Finally, it has a "learning center" where you can study and review the vocabulary that came up in the video.

My suggestion for FluentU would be to listen to any videos you like and note down any words you don't know. Try to guess the meaning from the context of the listening first, because this is a useful skill to develop for the IELTS test. Then use the "hover-over" tool to confirm the meaning. Even if you just watch one video a day, your vocabulary will expand quickly.

A good way to practice synonyms and paraphrasing is to listen to a short video and think about how each sentence or phrase could be paraphrased. If you do this regularly, over time you will get used to common synonyms, and this will really help you in all parts of the IELTS test.
