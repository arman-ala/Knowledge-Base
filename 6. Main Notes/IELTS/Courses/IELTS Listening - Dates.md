## Make sure you know how to spell all the difficult days and months.

- Make sure you are aware of the spelling of all the days of the week, especially difficult ones like Wednesday. This is also true for months like February. Also, if you don‚Äôt put a capital letter at the beginning of these words, you will be incorrect.
  
- Also be aware of some synonyms such as ‚Äòweekend‚Äô for Saturday and Sunday or ‚Äòfortnight‚Äô for two weeks.
  
- There are also different ways of saying and writing dates, for example:
  - ‚ÄòThe eleventh of September 2002‚Äô could be written as ‚Äò11 September 2002.‚Äô
  
- Again, pay attention to the word limit in the question and only write under this limit.
