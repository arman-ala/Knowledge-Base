In this module we will:
- Learn about the 4 marking criteria that examiners use to mark our task 2 answer.
- Break each of the 4 down into simple language.
- Find out exactly what we need to do (and what you should not do) to get a band 7, 8 or 9.
- Look at good and bad examples.
  
## Think like an examiner! 
- The only way to get a high score is to know how the exam is marked.
- The key to getting over a 7 is to give the examiner exactly what they want and nothing else.
- All of my teaching is based on this principle.
- Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything first time. We will constantly be referring back to this module throughout the course.
