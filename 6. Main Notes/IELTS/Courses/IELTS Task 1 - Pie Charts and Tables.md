### Introduction
The graphs below show the primary social networking websites of British users in 2010 and projected figures for 2018.

The pie charts display the main social networks for users in England, Wales, and Scotland in 2010 and predicted numbers for 2018.

### Overview

- We will include the four general trends we spotted when analyzing both graphs.

Overall, Facebook had the biggest market share in 2010 and this is expected to grow even more in the future. Twitter will continue to be significant in 2018 with only a small decline, but all others will fall to minimal levels.

### Details I

In 2010, Facebook had **nearly half** of the overall share and this is set to increase to **nearly three quarters** of the total in 2018. The next biggest website was Twitter with **nearly a fifth** in 2010, and it is predicted that this will remain the second biggest network, with only around a **1% drop**.

### Details 2

Pinterest is set to become the **biggest loser** with a loss of nearly **10%**, from 16.95% to 7.25%. It is thought that Google Plus will become the **least** used social network in 2018 with a drop of **nearly** **8%** to just **2.9%**. Despite Bebo being used by nearly **a tenth** of British users in 2010, it is projected to **disappear completely** by 2018.
