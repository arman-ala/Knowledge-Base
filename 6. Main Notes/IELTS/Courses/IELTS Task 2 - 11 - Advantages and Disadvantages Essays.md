### What is an Advantages and Disadvantages Question?

Advantages and disadvantages essays evaluate pros and cons of a topic. Examples:

- "Tourists visit difficult places like Sahara. What benefits and disadvantages for tourists?" (Type 1: Discuss both.)
- "International student exchanges beneficial? Do advantages outweigh disadvantages?" (Type 2: Opinion on outweighing.)

### Two Types

**Type 1: Discuss Advantages and Disadvantages**  
Full Question: "Some people think that computer games are bad for children, while others believe that they are useful. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of computer games."  
Task: Explain 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages, no opinion needed.

**Type 2: Do Advantages Outweigh Disadvantages?**  
Full Question: "Some people think that computer games are bad for children, while others believe that they are useful. Do you think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?"  
Task: State if advantages or disadvantages are stronger (e.g., disadvantages outweigh), explain both with bias toward opinion.

### How to Tell the Difference

Type 1: "Discuss advantages and disadvantages."  
Type 2: "Do advantages outweigh...?" or "More advantages or disadvantages?"

### How This Affects Structure

Type 1: Balanced (intro outline, advantages para, disadvantages para, summary).  
Type 2: Opinion-led (intro opinion, weaker side para, stronger side para, restate opinion).

### Examples for Each Type

**Type 1 Full Example Essay**  
Question: "Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?"

Introduction:  
An increasing number of travelers are exploring harsh environments like the Sahara Desert or Antarctica. The primary benefits include personal enrichment and cultural exposure, whereas the main disadvantages are health risks and high costs.

Advantages Paragraph:  
One significant benefit is the opportunity for personal growth through adventure. Facing extreme conditions builds resilience and self-confidence, as tourists push their physical and mental limits. For instance, completing a Sahara trek can transform participants' perspectives on life. Furthermore, such trips offer unique cultural immersion. Visitors interact with local communities adapted to tough climates, gaining insights into sustainable living practices. For example, Antarctic expeditions often include educational sessions with indigenous knowledge holders, enriching tourists' understanding of global diversity.

Disadvantages Paragraph:  
However, these destinations pose serious health hazards. Extreme weather can lead to injuries, dehydration, or hypothermia, endangering lives. Another drawback is the exorbitant expense involved. Specialized gear, guides, and transport inflate costs dramatically. For instance, a week-long Antarctic cruise can exceed $10,000 per person, making it inaccessible for many.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, while extreme tourism fosters personal development and cultural appreciation, it is marred by substantial safety concerns and financial burdens.

**Type 2 Full Example Essay**  
Question: "Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students. Do you think its advantages outweigh the disadvantages?" (Opinion: Advantages outweigh.)

Introduction:  
International student exchange programs are increasingly popular among educators for teenagers. Although they present challenges like homesickness, I believe the advantages, such as cultural broadening and language skills, far outweigh the disadvantages.

Disadvantages Paragraph (Weaker Side):  
One potential downside is emotional strain from separation. Teenagers may experience homesickness or culture shock, impacting their well-being. For example, some students in exchange programs report initial depression. However, I believe this is temporary and outweighed by long-term gains.

Advantages Paragraph (Stronger Side):  
The primary advantage is enhanced cultural awareness. Exposure to diverse lifestyles promotes tolerance and global perspectives. Additionally, participants improve language proficiency through immersion. For instance, a year in Spain can elevate a student's Spanish from basic to fluent, boosting future opportunities. I maintain that these benefits significantly surpass any short-term difficulties.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, despite minor emotional hurdles, international exchanges enrich teenagers culturally and linguistically, making the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages.

**Another Type 2 Full Example (Disadvantages Outweigh)**  
Question: "Many people work long hours, leaving very little time for leisure activities. Does this situation have more advantages or more disadvantages?"

Introduction:  
Numerous professionals opt for extended workdays, curtailing leisure time. Although this may accelerate career growth, I contend that the disadvantages, particularly health deterioration, predominate.

Advantages Paragraph (Weaker Side):  
Working long hours can expedite professional advancement. Increased productivity often leads to promotions and higher earnings. For instance, Elon Musk's employees at Tesla endure 80-hour weeks, many rising quickly in ranks. Nevertheless, I believe such gains are fleeting compared to health costs.

Disadvantages Paragraph (Stronger Side):  
The chief disadvantage is severe impact on physical and mental health. Prolonged stress without rest elevates risks of burnout, heart disease, and anxiety. For example, Japan's karoshi phenomenon claims thousands of lives yearly from overwork. In my view, this underscores why disadvantages vastly outnumber advantages.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, while long hours promise career boosts, their toll on well-being renders the disadvantages far more significant.

### Analysis of Provided Examples (Full Versions)

**Work Ethic Type 1 Full Essay**  
Question: "In certain places, young people are brought up to believe that if they have a strong work ethic, they can be whatever they want to be. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this belief?"

Introduction:  
In certain places, young people are brought up to believe that if they have a strong work ethic, they can be whatever they want to be. The main benefits of this are higher self-esteem and the development of grit; however, the key drawbacks are delusion and poor job prospects.

Advantages Paragraph:  
Instilling the belief that a child can achieve their dreams with hard work helps children build confidence in themselves. Striving for a goal and seeing sacrifices pay off is incredibly rewarding and each time a child sees this reward, they become more confident that they can repeat this success. Furthermore, this builds perseverance, resolve and determination, otherwise known as 'grit', which are essential characteristics for success in life. Once a child understands that their hard work and effort is what dictates success, they never give up until their goals have been achieved. In her book called Grit, Angela Duckworth studied achievement and concluded that determination was essential for accomplishment.

Disadvantages Paragraph:  
However, if one blindly follows their dreams, they can become deluded. This is because they can develop an unshakeable belief in themselves which is not rooted in reality. Another disadvantage is that people with this mindset can get stuck in jobs with meagre salaries. When their confidence and determination result in them pursuing careers that aren't realistic for them, employers don't share the same belief in their potential and they don't get the jobs they had dreamed of. For instance, Los Angeles is full of failed actors who believe they will be the next Hollywood star but are forced to do service jobs that require no formal education.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, sending the message to a child that they can be anything they set their mind to can be a very positive thing because it helps them develop into a fulfilled person who has the requisite soft skills required for success. However, it should be rooted in reality to avoid self-delusion and poor career choices.

**Work Hours Type 2 Full Essay**  
Question: "Many people work long hours, leaving very little time for leisure activities. Does this situation have more advantages or more disadvantages?"

Introduction:  
Many workers decide to dedicate themselves to their jobs, but this means they have fewer hours of free time. Although this can help their careers, I believe that there are more drawbacks because it will negatively impact their health.

Advantages Paragraph:  
The main reason people work extra hours is to gain a promotion. In many jobs, an employee is in competition with their colleagues, and those that achieve the greatest productivity are most likely to be promoted. For instance, Elon Musk demands that his employees at Tesla and Space X work 7 days a week, and those that cannot maintain that pace are very unlikely to remain with the company. However, I believe that any promotions earned will be short-lived as working in this way is not sustainable.

Disadvantages Paragraph:  
The disadvantage is that working very arduous hours can be detrimental to a personâ€™s wellbeing. This is because, without time to unwind, stress from work increases and affects both an individual's physical and mental health. For example, many lawyers leave the profession well before retirement because of the negative health implications of being expected to work more than 80 hours per week. As maintaining a healthy body and mind is so important for human beings, I'm of the opinion that working long hours has too many disadvantages.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, although it might be tempting to make career advancement the number one priority by working extra hours, one must consider the sustainability of such an approach due to an increased likelihood of poor wellbeing. For these reasons, the negatives far outnumber the positives.
