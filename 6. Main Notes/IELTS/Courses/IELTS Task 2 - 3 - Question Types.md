The 5 types of questions are:
1. Opinion (Agree or Disagree)
	- They always start with someone else's opinion, a one-sided statement.
	- Examples:
		*Every year, several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.*
		**Do you agree or disagree?**
		
		*Being a celebrity—such as a famous film star or sports personality—brings more problems than benefits.*
		**Do you think that being a celebrity brings more problems?**
		
2. Discussion (Discuss both views)
	- In opinion question, we had one-sided statement but for discussion we will be given **BOTH SIDE** opinions.
	- Examples:
		*Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest times of most people's lives. Others think that adult life brings more happiness, in spite of greater responsibilities.*
		**Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**
		
		*Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.*
		**Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**
		
1. Advantages and Disadvantages
	- It is a general statement. You will always be given only a statement, and then you are asked to discuss advantages and disadvantages.
	- They are easy to find, you only need to find words like advantages, disadvantages, benefits, profit, downside, flaw and drawbacks.
	- Examples:
		*Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school.*
		**Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?**  
		
		*In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.*
		**Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.**
		
2. Problem/Causes and Solution
	- Examples:
		*In some countries, the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing.*
		**What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?**
		
		*Global warming is one of the biggest threats humans face in the 21st century, and sea levels are continuing to rise at alarming rates.*
		**What problems are associated with this, and what are some possible solutions?**
		
3. Double Question
	- Examples:
		*Today more people are traveling than ever before.*
		**Why is this the case?**
		**What are the benefits of traveling for the traveler?**
		
		*Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems.*
		**To what extent do you agree or disagree?**
		**What other measures do you think might be effective?**
### Why is this important?
- If we don't do what the question asks us to do, then it is very difficult to get a high mark.
- For instance:
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing trafiic and pollution problems.
	  To waht extent do you agree or disagree?</mark>
	  What other measures do you think might be effective?
	- If we don't answer the second question properly our score will not go higher than 5.

- Why is this important?
	- If you write about the general topic, you have not answered the question.
	- If you can't tell the difference between the topic and the keywords, you can't answer the question.
	- If we do not think about instructions, we won't be able to answer the question correctly.
