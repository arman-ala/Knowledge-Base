### Some letters are more difficult to distinguish than others. The test will normally have the difficult letters.

- If there is a word, such as a surname or address, that is unfamiliar to most people, the recording will spell it out.
- Make sure you familiarise yourself with how all the letters sound.
- You could also categorise them by similar sound.
- For example, B, D, E, T, G, P, and C all have a similar final sound and may be used to try and trick you.
