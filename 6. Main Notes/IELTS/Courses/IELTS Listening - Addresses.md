### Each country has a different address format. IELTS will normally use UK or Australian addresses.

It is normally:

- House/Flat Number  
- Street Name  
- Town/City Name  

Finally, you might have to write down a postcode. These always start and end with one or two letters first (normally the same as the city) and then a series of numbers in between. Make sure you write down both the letters and numbers. Example: M1 4JH  

**For example:**  
22 South Street  
Bristol  
BS1 5TW
