### What is a Double Question Essay?

Hey, as your IELTS instructor, a double question essay in Task 2 asks you to answer two distinct but related questions about a topic, requiring direct responses to both in a structured way. Unlike opinion or discussion essays, it demands clear answers to each question, often one explaining a cause or reason and another stating your opinion or solution. Examples include:
- "Most employers do job interviews. Is this the best way? What’s the best method in your opinion?"
- "Why are crime novels popular? What’s your opinion of them?"

Your goal: Address both questions equally, using 250-300 words, with 5 minutes planning, 30 writing, and 5 reviewing.

### Common Mistakes

Avoid these to keep your score high:
- Ignoring one question in the intro or essay.
- Focusing heavily on one question, leaving the other underdeveloped.
- Treating it like an opinion essay (arguing one side only).
- Writing like a discussion essay (balancing two views).

### Band 9 Checklist

- Clear intro answering both questions directly.
- Two separate body paragraphs, one per question.
- Fully developed ideas with explanations and examples.
- Equal paragraph length (80-100 words each).
- Short conclusion summarizing both answers.

### Structure

- **Paragraph 1 (Introduction)**: Paraphrase question, answer both parts briefly.
- **Paragraph 2 (Question 1)**: Topic sentence, explanation, example.
- **Paragraph 3 (Question 2)**: Topic sentence, explanation, example.
- **Paragraph 4 (Conclusion)**: Summarize answers for both questions.

### Planning and Idea Generation

1. **Question Analysis (2 mins)**:
   - Identify two questions (e.g., Why self-employed? Disadvantages?).
   - Note keywords (e.g., self-employed, disadvantages).
   - Check for opinion or explanation (e.g., "Why?" = cause; "Do you think?" = opinion).

2. **Idea Generation (Coffee Shop Method, 3 mins)**:
   - Question 1: Why? Brainstorm reasons (e.g., self-employed: freedom, control).
   - Question 2: Disadvantages/Opinion? List ideas (e.g., financial risk, instability).
   - Examples: Real-world, generalized (e.g., freelancers’ income struggles).

3. **Outline**:
   - Intro: Paraphrase + answer both.
   - Para 1: Answer Q1 + support.
   - Para 2: Answer Q2 + support.
   - Conclusion: Recap both.

### Sample Full Essays for Each Provided Example

**Sample 1: Self-Employment**  
Question: "Nowadays many people choose to be self-employed, rather than work for a company or organisation. Why might this be the case? What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?"

**Introduction**:  
Increasingly, individuals opt for self-employment over traditional corporate jobs. This trend stems from the desire for autonomy and flexibility, but it carries disadvantages like financial instability and lack of benefits.  

**Paragraph 1 (Why)**:  
The primary reason for choosing self-employment is the pursuit of independence. People value controlling their schedules and work decisions, avoiding corporate bureaucracy. For example, freelancers often cite the ability to choose clients and projects as a key motivator, with many graphic designers thriving on creative freedom.  

**Paragraph 2 (Disadvantages)**:  
However, self-employment brings significant challenges, notably financial uncertainty. Without a fixed salary, income fluctuates, making budgeting difficult. Additionally, self-employed individuals lack employer-provided benefits like health insurance or pensions. For instance, many Uber drivers in the US struggle with inconsistent earnings and no retirement plans.  

**Conclusion**:  
In summary, while self-employment offers autonomy, its drawbacks, such as unpredictable income and absent benefits, pose substantial risks.  

**Sample 2: Home Ownership**  
Question: "In some countries, owning a home rather than renting is very important for people. Why might this be the case? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?"

**Introduction**:  
In many societies, home ownership is prioritized over renting due to cultural and financial factors. While it fosters stability, I view it as a negative development due to economic pressures.  

**Paragraph 1 (Why)**:  
People prioritize home ownership for its perceived security and status. Culturally, owning a home symbolizes success and permanence, especially in countries like China where it’s tied to family values. Financially, property is seen as a stable investment. For example, in the UK, rising house prices encourage buying over renting for long-term gains.  

**Paragraph 2 (Opinion)**:  
I believe this trend is largely negative because it burdens individuals with debt. High mortgages trap people in long-term financial strain, limiting flexibility. For instance, in Australia, young buyers often take 30-year loans, delaying other life goals like travel or education. This outweighs stability benefits in today’s dynamic economy.  

**Conclusion**:  
In conclusion, cultural and financial incentives drive home ownership, but its financial burdens make it a negative trend overall.  

**Sample 3: Crime Fiction Popularity**  
Question: "In many countries today, crime novels and TV crime dramas are becoming more and more popular. Why do you think these books and TV shows are popular? What is your opinion of crime fiction and TV crime dramas?"

**Introduction**:  
Crime novels and TV dramas are gaining popularity worldwide. This is due to their thrilling narratives and psychological intrigue, though I find them overly sensationalized and thus less valuable.  

**Paragraph 1 (Why Popular)**:  
Crime stories captivate audiences with suspense and complex plots. They offer escapism through high-stakes mysteries, appealing to readers and viewers seeking excitement. For example, shows like "Sherlock" draw millions globally due to their clever storytelling and dramatic twists.  

**Paragraph 2 (Opinion)**:  
In my view, crime fiction and dramas are often overrated because they glorify violence and exaggerate reality. While entertaining, they can desensitize viewers to real-world issues or promote fear. For instance, series like "Breaking Bad" romanticize crime, overshadowing its grim consequences.  

**Conclusion**:  
In summary, crime fiction’s popularity stems from thrilling narratives, but its tendency to sensationalize makes it less commendable in my view.  

**Sample 4: Job Interviews (Your Example)**  
Question: "Most employers do job interviews before offering a position to a person. Do you think this is the best way to do it? What is the best method of choosing employees in your opinion?"

**Introduction**:  
Many companies conduct interviews before making a job offer to someone. This essay will argue that this is not the most appropriate way to recruit people because an interview is not a true reflection of a person’s ability. The best method is to give people standardized tests designed to assess on-the-job performance.  

**Paragraph 1 (Is Interview Best?)**:  
Conducting interviews is not a very effective recruitment method because it does not give the interviewee a chance to show how good they really are. The skills tested in an interview, such as the ability to communicate in a friendly manner and answering questions without any assistance, are the opposite of those required by many jobs. For example, a skilled computer programmer or lab technician may be socially awkward and used to consulting the internet before answering a question, and they would never be able to show how technically proficient they are.  

**Paragraph 2 (Best Method)**:  
A better way to find new employees would be to test them on things that they will actually be doing on the job. This is more reliable because it tests the specific skills they will use on a daily basis and not just an interview technique. Often, companies will invite someone to their offices for a whole day and ask them to complete routine tasks and ask a manager to give feedback on their performance. For instance, Facebook gives potential programmers a real program to debug or asks them to hack into their system.  

**Conclusion**:  
In conclusion, interviews have limitations because they often test interviewing skills rather than job-related skills, and a better test would be to give prospects a challenge that simulates the real job.  

### Analysis of Your Example (Job Interviews)

**Introduction**:  
- **Strengths**: Clear paraphrase, directly answers both questions (interviews not best, tests better), concise.  
- **Weakness**: "Not the most appropriate" could be sharper ("ineffective").  
- **Improvement**: "This essay contends interviews are ineffective, favoring standardized job-specific tests."

**Paragraph 1**:  
- **Strengths**: Strong topic sentence, explains why interviews fail (irrelevant skills), programmer example relevant.  
- **Weakness**: Slightly repetitive ("not a true reflection"/"not show how good").  
- **Improvement**: "Interviews fail to assess job-specific skills, as sociable responses don’t reflect technical ability."

**Paragraph 2**:  
- **Strengths**: Clear solution (job-specific tests), Facebook example specific, explains reliability.  
- **Weakness**: "Often" vague—specify frequency or company types.  
- **Improvement**: "Tech firms like Facebook test programmers with real tasks, ensuring skill alignment."

**Conclusion**:  
- **Strengths**: Summarizes both answers, reinforces stance.  
- **Weakness**: Could be more concise.  
- **Improvement**: "In conclusion, interviews test irrelevant skills, whereas job-specific challenges better assess true ability."
