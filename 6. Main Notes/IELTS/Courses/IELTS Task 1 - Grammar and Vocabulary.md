### G&V Strategy

- Think about what the question is asking you to do, e.g.:
	- Describe a general upward trend
	- Describe change in detail
	- Compare two pieces of data
- Think about the most appropriate structure.
- Check sentences to make sure they are grammatically correct.
- Remember that you should focus on accuracy, not range.

### Verbs, Nouns, Adverbs, and Adjectives

- It is essential that you know the difference between these four different types of words.
- A *noun* is a thing or a person.
- A ~~verb~~ is an action.
- An **adjective** is a describing word.
- An adverb describes a verb or adjective.
- The **fat** *man* ~~walked~~ silently.

### Describing General Trends

- You will have to do this for graphs over time.
- There are two main grammar structures that you need to learn in order to do this effectively in the exam.

1. **There + be + adj. + noun + in + noun phrase**

	- **USA:** There was a significant increase in the price of sugar.
	- **China:** There was a dramatic rise in the price of sugar.
	- **Germany:** There was a gradual growth in the price of sugar.
2. **Noun phrase + verb + adverb**
	- In the USA, the price of sugar increased significantly.
	- The price of sugar rose dramatically in China.
	- The price of sugar in Germany rose gradually.

### Describing Change

You will normally have to describe how the data changes in the details paragraphs, such as increases and decreases. You will also have to describe change when comparing two or more dates.

There are three ways you can do this:

1. **Noun phrase + verb + adverb**
	![[IELTS Task 1 - Grammar and Vocabulary E2.png]]
	- The population of the USA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">will decrease</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">slightly</mark>.
	- China’s population <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is projected to grow</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">considerably</mark>.
	- The population of Germany <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is predicted to decline</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">sharply</mark>.  
2. **There + be + noun + in + noun phrase**
	- There will be a decline in the population of the USA.
	- There is predicted to be a surge in China’s population.
	- There will be a decrease in Germany’s population.  
3. **Using fractions or multipliers**
	- The population of the USA will increase by nearly a half.
	- The population of China will nearly double by 2050.
	- The population of Germany will be less than half of what it was in 2015.

### Making Comparisons

- It is essential that you are able to make comparative structures.
- They include:
	- **More/few/less + noun + than**
		- More people use Facebook than any other site.
		- Fewer people use Twitter than Facebook.
	- **One-syllable adjective –er + than**
		- A higher number of people use Facebook than any other site.
		- A lower number of people use Twitter than Facebook.
	- **More/less + adjective of more than one syllable**
		- Facebook was more popular than any other social network.
	- **One-syllable –est**
		- Bebo had the lowest figures of any social network.
	- **The most/least + adjective of more than one syllable**
		- The most popular site was Facebook, and the least popular was Bebo.

### Task 1 Tenses

It is essential that you look at the dates of the graph/chart and then adjust your tenses accordingly.
The examiners will be looking for your ability to do this.
Think about whether the data is past, present, or future.
The main tenses are:
  - Past simple
  - Present perfect
  - Present perfect continuous
  - Present simple
  - Future perfect
  - Will (future)
  
|**Tense**|**When to Use**|**How to Spot It**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Past Simple**|For trends or events fully in the past, already completed.|Dates are all before today (e.g., 2010–2020), no link to now.|_Sales dropped by 15% in 2019._|
|**Present Perfect**|For changes starting in the past that still matter or connect to the present.|Data spans from past to now (e.g., 2020–2025) or impacts today.|_Unemployment has fallen since 2022._|
|**Present Perfect Continuous**|For ongoing trends from the past to now, emphasizing they’re still happening.|Continuous trends from past to present, focusing on duration.|_CO2 emissions have been rising for a decade._|
|**Present Simple**|For current data, facts, or snapshots of what’s true right now.|Data is for the current year (2025) or describes a present state.|_In 2025, 40% of cars are electric._|
|**Future Perfect**|For predictions about what will be completed by a specific future point.|Chart shows projections (e.g., 2025–2030) with “estimated” or “projected” labels.|_By 2030, renewable energy will have hit 50%._|
|**Will (Future)**|For general predictions or expected trends in the future.|Future data with terms like “expected” or “predicted.”|_Population will grow by 5% by 2035._|
- Use **past simple** for stuff that’s done and dusted.
- Go for **present perfect** or **present perfect continuous** if the trend links the past to now.
- Stick with **present simple** for what’s happening today.
- Use **will** or **future perfect** for future guesses, depending on whether it’s a general trend or a specific milestone.
