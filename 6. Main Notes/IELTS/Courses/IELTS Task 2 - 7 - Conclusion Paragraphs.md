### Why Conclusions Are Important

Conclusions are your final impression on the examiner. They prove you can summarize your points, keep your opinion clear, and make the essay cohesive. A strong conclusion ties everything together and boosts your Band score.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

Steer clear of these traps:

- Adding new ideas (save them for body paragraphs).
- Being overly entertaining or informal.
- Staying too vague or general.
- Copying body paragraphs word-for-word.
- Using informal cohesive devices like "In a nutshell" or "All in all."

### Appropriate Cohesive Devices

Use these for a polished close:

- In conclusion,
- To conclude,

Avoid informal ones:

- All in all
- In sum
- To sum up
- Finally
- In a nutshell

### Structure of a Good Conclusion

A Band 7+ conclusion needs:

- Summary of main points.
- Clear restatement of your opinion.
- One concise sentence.

**Quick Cheat**: Paraphrase your introduction’s thesis, weaving in body paragraph points. No new info—just a tight recap.

### How to Write a Conclusion in Detail

1. **Start with a cohesive device**: "In conclusion" or "To conclude" signals the end.
2. **Summarize main points**: Briefly restate body paragraph ideas (e.g., for fast food tax, mention healthcare costs and reduced demand).
3. **Restate opinion**: Reinforce your stance (e.g., agree/disagree) without repeating the intro verbatim.
4. **Keep it one sentence**: Blend summary and opinion for brevity.
5. **Paraphrase**: Use fresh words to show vocab range.

Example process for fast food tax question:

- Intro: "This essay totally agrees... because illnesses cost health services too much and higher prices reduce demand."
- Conclusion: "In conclusion, taxing fast food is justified as it alleviates healthcare burdens and discourages unhealthy eating."

### Analysis of Your Conclusion Examples

1. **Overpopulation Example**
    
    - **Text**: "In conclusion, there are too many people in the world and this is a huge threat to everyone because essential resources are running out and we are also polluting our planet."
    - **Strengths**: Uses "In conclusion" correctly, restates opinion (overpopulation is a threat), and summarizes key points (resources, pollution).
    - **Weakness**: Slightly repetitive ("huge threat" mirrors intro). Could use sharper synonyms for vocab range.
    - **Improvement**: "To conclude, overpopulation endangers humanity by depleting vital resources and increasing environmental damage."
2. **iPhone Ban Example**
    
    - **Text**: "In conclusion, mobiles are not a good idea for young children because they interfere with the learning process and this should be stopped by telling parents that they are not allowed in schools."
    - **Strengths**: Clear opinion (ban mobiles), summarizes distraction issue, and mentions the solution (school ban).
    - **Weakness**: Too wordy for one sentence; "telling parents" is informal. Needs conciseness and formality.
    - **Improvement**: "In conclusion, mobile devices disrupt young children’s learning and should be banned from schools."

### Sample Conclusions

1. **Fast Food Tax Question**:  
    In conclusion, higher fast food taxes are essential to reduce healthcare costs and curb demand for unhealthy options, promoting a healthier society.
    
2. **Overpopulation Question**:  
    To conclude, the global population surge threatens humanity by exhausting resources and worsening pollution.
    
3. **iPhone Ban Question**:  
    In conclusion, banning mobile devices in classrooms is necessary to minimize distractions and enhance children’s learning.
    

### How to Review Your Conclusion

To ensure your conclusion shines:

1. **Check Task Response**: Does it restate your opinion and summarize main points without new ideas?
2. **Coherence**: Is it clear and linked to your intro/body? Use "In conclusion" or "To conclude."
3. **Vocabulary**: Use synonyms (e.g., "mitigate" instead of "reduce") to avoid repetition.
4. **Grammar**: Ensure correct tense and sentence structure.
5. **Brevity**: Keep it one sentence, formal, and precise.  
    Tip: Read it aloud to catch awkward phrasing.
