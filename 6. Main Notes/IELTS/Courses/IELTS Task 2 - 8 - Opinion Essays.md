### What is an Opinion Essay?

Hey, as your IELTS instructor, an opinion essay asks you to state and support your view on a topic. It's common in Task 2—think "Do you agree or disagree?" questions. You pick a side and argue it fully, no waffling.

### Difference Between the Two Types

First type: Straight "Do you agree or disagree?" (e.g., "In many countries it is now illegal to advertise alcohol. Do you agree or disagree?")—clear yes/no stance.

Second type: "To what extent do you agree or disagree?" (e.g., "Wealthy countries should accept more refugees and provide them with basic assistance, such as food and housing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?")—nuanced, so always say "strongly agree" or "strongly disagree" for clarity.

### Common Mistakes

Don't fall into these:

- Forgetting your opinion entirely.
- Hiding it until the conclusion.
- Rambling about others' views.
- Balancing both sides (that's for discussion essays).

### Band 9 Checklist

Hit these for top marks:

- Clear opinion in the intro.
- Two solid points backing it.
- Full development with explanations and examples.
- Short conclusion recapping points and opinion.

### How to Quickly Decide Your Opinion

It wastes time overthinking—your personal view doesn't count. Just pick one side, the one you can write easily about. Brainstorm quick pros/cons and go with the stronger ideas.

### Structure of an Opinion Essay

Keep it tight: Intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion.

- **Paragraph 1 (Introduction)**: Paraphrase question, state opinion, outline main points.
- **Supporting Paragraph 1**: Topic sentence, explanations, example.
- **Supporting Paragraph 2**: Topic sentence, explanations, example.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of points and opinion restate.

### Sample Introduction and Conclusion

Question: Most high-level positions in companies are filled by men even though the workforce in many developed countries is more than 50 percent female. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of these positions to women. Do you agree?

Introduction:  
It is argued that corporations should be compelled to give a certain proportion of their executive level roles to females, given that over half of the workforce are women. This essay agrees with that statement because women are capable of doing a job to the same level as a man, and girls are currently outperforming boys on many university courses.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, men should not be given the majority of high-level jobs in businesses because women can perform at the same level as men and also do better academically.

### Question Analysis for Planning

Take: "In many countries it is now illegal to advertise alcohol. Do you agree or disagree?"

- **Topic Words**: Alcohol advertising.
- **Keywords**: Illegal, advertise.
- **Instruction Words**: Do you agree or disagree?
- **Decide Opinion**: Agree (easy ideas on health/social harms).

### Idea Generation (Coffee Shop Method)

Why agree? Chat it out like at a coffee shop:

- Alcohol causes social/health problems.
- Exploits alcoholics.
- Ads sway people to drink.
- Exposes youth to glitzy persuasion.

Pick two strongest: Health/social issues; Influence on vulnerable groups.

### Planning the Structure

- **Paragraph 1 (Introduction)**: Paraphrase question, agree, outline points (health/social problems; influence via ads).
- **Supporting Paragraph 1**: Topic sentence (health/social problems), explanations (addiction, bad behavior), example (Russia's alcohol ad ban reduced binge drinking).
- **Supporting Paragraph 2**: Topic sentence (influence), explanations (glamorizes drinking, targets youth), example (Budweiser ads linking beer to fun parties).
- **Conclusion**: Summary.

### Analysis of Your Examples

1. **Gender Quota Introduction**:
    
    - **Strengths**: Strong paraphrase, clear "agrees," outlines two points (capability, academic edge). Sets up essay perfectly.
    - **Weakness**: Minor awkward phrasing ("give a certain proportion... to females")—could say "allocate quotas for women."
    - **Improvement**: "This essay agrees... because women are equally capable in roles and outperform men academically in many fields."
2. **Gender Quota Conclusion**:
    
    - **Strengths**: Restates opinion, summarizes points concisely.
    - **Weakness**: Starts negatively ("men should not be given")—flip to positive for punch. Slightly repetitive.
    - **Improvement**: "In conclusion, mandating quotas for women in executive roles is vital, as they match men's performance and excel academically."
3. **Alcohol Ad Planning Ideas**:
    
    - **Strengths**: Coffee shop method sparks relatable ideas; focuses on agree side with specifics (addiction, youth).
    - **Weakness**: Examples vague—Russia needs detail; "specific advert" should name one.
    - **Improvement**: For Russia: "In Russia, banning ads cut alcohol-related deaths by 10%." For ad: "Ads like Heineken's party scenes glamorize excess for teens."
