#### Sample Introduction

It is argued that states should charge fast food companies more tax because of the growing amount of men and women with health conditions associated with this type of food. This essay totally agrees with that statement because these illnesses cost the health service too much money and increasing the price of junk food would reduce the demand for it.

### Why Body Paragraphs Are Crucial

These make up 70-80% of your essay, so they're the heart of it. They keep your opinion crystal clear from start to finish, fully tackle the question, and build a rock-solid position with extended, supported ideas. Nail them, and you're golden for higher bands.

### Common Mistakes to Dodge

Watch out for these pitfalls—they tank your score fast:

- Cramming too many ideas into one paragraph.
- Leaving ideas half-baked without depth.
- Skipping explanations or examples altogether (or making them weak).
- Leaning on boring lists like "Firstly, secondly, thirdly, finally" to organize.
- Sloppy grammar and vocab that muddies your message.

### Band 9 Checklist for Body Paragraphs

Aim for this to shine:

- Ideas that stick to the topic.
- Every part of the question covered fully.
- Your stance consistent and obvious.
- Ideas stretched out with strong support.

### The Perfect Structure for Main Body Paragraphs

Keep it simple: every paragraph needs three key elements—Topic Sentence, Explanation Sentences, and Example. (The intro and conclusion tweak based on the question, but bodies stay tight.) This setup guides the reader like road signs.

### Mastering Topic Sentences

This is your paragraph's opener—a short, punchy statement summing up what's coming. It answers the question head-on, links back to your intro's main ideas, and thinks of the reader (who's skimming). No fluff; save details for later. You can't nail one without brainstorming clear ideas first.

Example: For "Governments should tax fast food more to fight health issues—agree?"  
Topic Sentence: "Obesity-related illnesses cost taxpayers billions annually."

### Building Explanation Sentences

Here's where you unpack "So what?"—readers can't quiz you like in a chat, so spell it out. Pretend they're clueless on the topic. Explain what your topic sentence means, how it ties to the question, or its ripple effects. Aim for 2-4 sentences, asking yourself: Why? How? Where? When? What's the outcome?

Useful starters: "That is to say...," "In other words...," "This is because...," "As a result...," "Therefore...."

Example (continuing above): "People who eat too much fast food are more likely to suffer from costly diseases linked to being overweight. As a result, they visit hospitals more often for treatment, straining public health services."

### Nailing Examples

Examples back your point like evidence in court—they illustrate and strengthen without overcomplicating. They're easier to brainstorm than pure explanations, and we use them daily. Go for real-world ones over risky personal tales or unverified stats (those can backfire if examiners doubt them).

Types to use:

- Real examples (e.g., news events).
- Converted personal stories (make 'em general).

How to brainstorm:  
Draw from your life—where you're from, live, work, or family/friends—then generalize.

Conversion tricks:

- Personal: "My sister's UK bookshop shut down vs. Amazon." → General: "For instance, many UK bookshops have closed due to online competition."
- Personal: "I can't afford a laptop for my Irish kid." → General: "In Ireland, for example, high laptop prices stop most parents from buying them for school."
- Personal: "My rich lawyer friends got free uni—unfair." → General: "Many law students from middle-class backgrounds have parents who can cover fees easily."

Riskier? Skip raw personal stories, dodgy stats, surveys, or studies unless rock-solid.

Example: "The UK government added a 'sugar tax' to fizzy drinks, curbing sales and tackling obesity."

### Sample Body Paragraphs in Action

Question: In some countries, more folks face health woes from too much fast food. Should governments slap higher taxes on it? (Agree?)

Body 1:  
Obesity-related illnesses cost taxpayers billions every year. People overdoing fast food risk pricey overweight diseases, hitting hospitals harder and burdening health services. For example, a huge chunk of the UK's National Health Service budget goes to fixable issues like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes.

Body 2:  
Another reason to tax fast food extra? It hikes prices, slashing demand. Taxes fold into base costs, pricing out buyers of greasy grub, so folks eat less junk and get healthier overall. For example, the UK rolled out a 'sugar tax' on sweet sodas to battle the obesity surge, and it worked by dropping consumption.
