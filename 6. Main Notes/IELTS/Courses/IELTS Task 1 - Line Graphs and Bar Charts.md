# Introduction
Paraphrase: The line chart below displays the use of power from sun in the USA, Germany, Japan and China.

# Overview
Overall, America and China's use of solar power increased significantly over the entire period. Japan's use decreased gradually and Germany's remained relatively stable.

# Details 1
The United States was the biggest consumer of solar energy in 1995 with just below 8,000 and increased consistently every year to around 18,000 in 2015. China was the lowest overall user at the start of the period at around 1000, but steadily increased to just over 2000 over the next 10 years, before increasing consumption dramatically to become the second highest consumer with nearly 12,000 in 2015.

# Details 2
Japan's use began the recorded period with around 6,000 and this consistently dropped year on year to just below 4,000 in 2015. Germany's value hovered between approximately 2,000 and 3,000 throughout the entire period.

 Approximation phrases and words
In IELTS Writing Task 1, showing approximation is important when describing data, trends, or quantities that are not exact but close to a certain value. Using a variety of phrases to indicate approximation makes your writing more precise and natural. Below is a detailed list of phrases and words commonly used to show approximation, along with explanations and examples for each.

 Complete Guide to Approximation Phrases for IELTS Writing Task 1

1. **Just over / Just above**
