### It is essential that you get used to how ‘real’ English speakers talk.

- Many English teachers speak clearly and slowly to their students, and this can actually harm their progress.
- When you hear how native speakers actually talk, it is often very difficult to hear what is being said. This is mainly to do with connected speech.
- Connected speech is the linking of words and sounds together in a sentence. For example, “I have to go to the doctor; I have an earache” might sound more like “Iv’toged the doctor; Ivenearake.”
- Other sounds may appear ‘weak’ or change when put into a sentence. For instance, “Do you want to go?” might sound more like “De ye want te go?”

### Start off by listening to very short recordings and then build up to longer conversations.

- We can practice this by doing something called ‘micro-listening.’ It involves pausing a sentence you don’t understand and replaying it until you have understood all the words. Don’t worry about how many times you have to do this; focus on hearing every word and breaking down connected speech into individual words.
- Over time, you will get used to how words link together, so listening to native speakers will become much easier.
- Podcasts are perfect for this because you can pause and replay them easily. Podcasts are like individual radio shows that you can download and listen to whenever you like. I personally listen to them every day because there are literally millions of them on every topic you can think of. Whatever your interest, there will be a podcast about it.
