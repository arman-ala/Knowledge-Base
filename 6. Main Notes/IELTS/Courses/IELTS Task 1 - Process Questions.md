When you face process questions, keep in mind that, examiners know you are not a specialist of the field discussed in the diagram. All they want is to pick up simple things and explain them.

![[IELTS Task 1 - Process Question Example.png]]In the IELTS Academic Writing Task 1, process questions typically involve describing how something is made, how a system works, or how a natural phenomenon occurs. There are two main types of process questions:

### 1. **Cyclical Processes**
   - **Definition**: These processes involve a cycle where the end of one stage leads back to the beginning, forming a continuous loop.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - The process repeats itself over time.
     - There is no definitive "end" point; instead, it loops back to the starting point.
     - Often involves natural phenomena or systems that are inherently cyclical in nature.
   - **Example from the Image**:
     - The diagram on the right shows the **life cycle of the silkworm**, which is a cyclical process. It starts with eggs, progresses through larva and cocoon stages, and ends with the moth laying eggs again, restarting the cycle.

### 2. **Linear Processes**
   - **Definition**: These processes involve a sequence of steps that occur in a specific order, leading to a final product or outcome.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - There is a clear beginning and end.
     - Each step builds upon the previous one, moving forward in a linear fashion.
     - Often involves manufacturing or production processes.
     - Each stage, has its purpose which must be found.
   - **Example from the Image**:
     - The diagram on the left illustrates the **production of bricks**, which is a linear process. It starts with clay being dug up, followed by shaping, baking, cooling, and packaging, culminating in the delivery of the finished bricks.

### Key Differences Between Cyclical and Linear Processes:
| **Aspect**          | **Cyclical Processes**                           | **Linear Processes**                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**       | Repeats in a continuous loop                     | Moves forward in a straight sequence         |
| **Beginning/End**   | No definitive start or end (loops back)          | Clear beginning and end                      |
| **Nature of Steps** | Steps eventually lead back to the starting point | Steps lead to a final product/outcome        |
| **Examples**        | Life cycles (e.g., silkworm life cycle)          | Manufacturing processes (e.g., brick making) |

### Summary:
- **Cyclical processes** are repetitive and loop back to their starting point, often involving natural cycles.
- **Linear processes** follow a sequential order with a clear start and finish, typically involving production or manufacturing steps.

## How to answer a process question

1. Find the beginning and end of the process.
2. Understand the different stages of the process.
3. Write your introduction - Paraphrase Question.
4. Write Overview.
5. Divide process into 2 parts and write 2 paragraphs describing them.

### Structure

- *Paragraph 1 - Introduction*
	- example 1:
		- The diagram below shows the stages in the production of bricks.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The illustration demonstrates how bricks are produced.</mark>
	- example 2:
		- The diagrams below show the life cycle of the silkworm and the stages in the production of silk cloth.  
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The graphic illustrates the life process of the silkworm and the phases in the manufacture of silk material.</mark>
- *Paragraph 2 - Overview*
	- **Overview Checklist**
	1. How many stages are there?
	2. Man-made or natural?
	3. Cyclical or linear?
	4. What happens at the start and the end?
	5. Are there any raw materials?
	6. What is produced?
	- example 1:
		1. How many stages are there? 7
		2. Man-made or natural? Man-made
		3. Cyclical or linear? Linear
		4. What happens at the start and end? Digger digs clay and delivered.
		5. Are there any raw materials? Clay, sand and water.
		6. What is produced? Bricks.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Overall, it is a 7 stage, man-made, linear process. It begins with clay, water and sand being added as raw materials and finally results in bricks being delivered.</mark>
	- example 2:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Overall, the lifecycle is a natural process and contains four cyclical phases, beginning with the laying of eggs and ending with the birth of a new moth from a cocoon. The production of silk is, in contrast to the previous stage, a man-made linear process comprising of 6 main stages.</mark>
- *Paragraph 3 - Details 1*
- Next, we must describe each of the stages in more detail.
- You will have to decide first how to split your details into two paragraphs.
- You will then write out the details. You will have to think about:
	- Sequencing  
	- Showing purpose  
	- Passive or active voice
		- Many teachers tell students to use the passive voice  
		- for Task I process questions, but it is not that simple.  
		- You do use the passive voice for processes that are man-made, but not for natural processes.  
			- The river flows to the sea. (Active)
			- iPhones are assembled in China. (Passive: be + past participle.)
- *Paragraph 4 - Details 2*
	- example 1:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">First of all, an excavator digs out clay from the ground and places it on a metal grid where it passes over a rolling machine in order to separate out small and big pieces. After that, sand and water are added and this is either added to a mold or cut by a wire to produce bricks.
		  Following that, they are placed in an oven so that they can dry and are subsequently exposed to two different stages of heat in turn between 200-980 degrees Celsius in the first stage and 870-1300 degrees Celsius in the second. From this, the bricks are cooled in a cooling chamber for two to three days before they are packaged and then placed on a truck so that they can be transported.</mark>
	- example 2:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">To begin with, eggs are produced by the moth and it takes 10 days for the eggs to hatch into silkworm larvae that feed on mulberry leaves. This stage takes between 4 and 6 weeks before the worms construct a cocoon from silk thread, taking approximately one week. They stay there for around a fortnight, subsequently emerging as moths and the process can begin again. 
		 The first stage in the manufacture of silk is the selection of cocoons and these are then boiled. Once boiled, the silk thread is unwound to a length of between 300 and 900 meters. Finally, the silk can be twisted and weaved into cloth before being dyed.</mark>
