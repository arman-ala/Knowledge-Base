### You should familiarise yourself with how numbers sound in a range of different accents.

The numbers that often come up are:

- 13:30  
- 14:40  
- 15:50  
- 16:60  
- 17:70  
- 18:80  
- 19:90  

These numbers are difficult for many non-native speakers, which is why IELTS likes to use them. Practise listening and saying these numbers.
