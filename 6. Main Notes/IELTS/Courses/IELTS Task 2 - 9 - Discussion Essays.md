### What is a Discussion Essay? (Expanded Explanation)

A discussion essay requires balanced coverage of two opposing views on a topic, followed by your opinion. It's not just listing sides—you must analyze why each view holds, support with evidence, and clearly favor one. This tests critical thinking, coherence, and task response. Common in IELTS: "Discuss both views and give your opinion." Aim for 250-300 words; spend 5 mins planning, 30 writing, 5 reviewing.

Examples:

- Smartphones in classrooms: Aid vs. hinder learning.
- Juvenile crime: Adult punishment vs. rehabilitation.

Key: Equal space (80-100 words per body para), then opinion woven in.

### Common Mistakes (With Fixes)

1. **No Opinion**: Fix: State it in intro and conclusion; hint in bodies.
2. **One-Sided Focus**: Fix: Time each para equally; use "On the one hand/On the other hand."
3. **Uneven Development**: Fix: One main idea per para, with explanation + example.

Pro Tip: If unbalanced, examiners drop Task Response to 5-6 band.

### Band 9 Checklist (Detailed Breakdown)

- **Clear Intro Opinion**: Paraphrase + outline + stance (e.g., "I favor X despite Y's merits").
- **Two Points Per Side**: Depth over breadth—e.g., for smartphones: Aid (access/resources); Hinder (distraction/addiction).
- **Agree/Disagree Per Side**: End each body para with "However, I believe..." to show nuance.
- **Explanations + Examples**: Why (logic), how (impact), real-world (e.g., studies/countries).
- **Concise Conclusion**: 1-2 sentences; no new ideas.

Band 9 Sample Score: Lexical Resource (precise synonyms), Grammatical Range (complex sentences), Coherence (logical links).

### Deciding Opinion (Step-by-Step Guide)

1. **Scan Question**: Identify views (e.g., punish vs. rehab).
2. **Brainstorm Pros/Cons**: 1 min—list 2 ideas/side.
3. **Choose Stance**: Pick easier-to-argue side (e.g., rehab if you know programs). Always partial agree for nuance, but state clearly.
4. **Why Not Personal?**: Examiners care about arguments, not you—choose for strong support.

Trap: Indecision lowers Coherence.

### Structure (Full Template with Tips)

- **Intro (40-50 words)**: Hook paraphrase, outline views, opinion. Tip: Use "While X argue Y, I contend Z."
- **Body 1 (Negative View, 80-100 words)**: Topic sentence (e.g., "Proponents claim..."), 2-3 explanation sentences (why/how), example (specific, generalized), your rebuttal.
- **Body 2 (Positive View, 80-100 words)**: Mirror Body 1; end with agreement.
- **Conclusion (30-40 words)**: Restate views briefly, reinforce opinion, broader implication (e.g., "Thus, society benefits from...").

Total: 4 paras max; transitions: "Conversely," "Furthermore."

### Planning (In-Depth Process)

1. **Question Analysis (2 mins)**:
    
    - Topic: Core issue (e.g., drug treatment).
    - Keywords: Jail/prison vs. hospital/medical.
    - Instructions: Discuss both + opinion.
    - Paraphrase Ideas: "Incarcerate" for jail; "Therapy" for hospital.
2. **Idea Generation (Coffee Shop Method, 3 mins)**:
    
    - View 1 (Jail): Deters crime, protects society—ideas: Immediate removal, justice served.
    - View 2 (Hospital): Treats root cause, humane—ideas: Reduces relapse, cost-effective long-term.
    - Opinion: Favor hospital (stronger examples like Switzerland).
    - Examples: Real (countries/studies); Avoid personal.
3. **Outline Sketch**:
    
    - Intro: Paraphrase + opinion.
    - Body 1: Jail pros + your disagree.
    - Body 2: Hospital pros + your agree.
    - Conclusion: Weigh sides.

Use bullet notes; cross out weak ideas.

### Introduction (Crafting Tips + Variations)

Tips: Avoid question copy; vary vocab (e.g., "advocate imprisonment" not "send to jail"). End with opinion for direction.

Variations:

- Neutral: "Both sides have merits, but..."
- Strong: "Though jail seems logical, rehabilitation is superior because..."

Your Example Analysis (Expanded):

- Strengths: Balanced outline, clear opinion ("better to be compassionate").
- Teach: "While sentencing... quick solution" adds nuance—good! But formalize "quick and easy" to "immediate deterrent."

Improved: "While imprisonment offers a swift deterrent, I advocate medical rehabilitation for lasting recovery."

### Supporting Paragraphs (Deep Dive + Techniques)

**Technique**: PEEL (Point, Explain, Example, Link to Opinion).

- Point: Topic sentence.
- Explain: 2 sentences—cause/effect.
- Example: 1 sentence—specific, credible.
- Link: "Nevertheless, I maintain..."

**Negative Para Tips**: Present fairly, then rebut gently to show balance.

Your Jail Para Analysis:

- Strengths: Clear short-term focus, US example (realistic), strong rebuttal (access in prison).
- Teach: Explains impact ("stop them using... harm to others")—excellent causality. Statistic would elevate: "Yet, 60% relapse post-release."
- Improvement: Add transition: "This approach, however, overlooks..."

**Positive Para Tips**: Build to agreement; use positive language.

Your Hospital Para Analysis:

- Strengths: Long-term focus, Switzerland stat (80% drop—impactful), societal benefit link.
- Teach: "Root cause addressed"—deep analysis. Compassion angle adds humanity.
- Improvement: Quantify more: "Programs like these have lowered national addiction rates by X%."

Practice: Write one para per view in 10 mins; vary sentence starters.

### Conclusion (Refinement Lessons)

Tips: Echo intro; add forward-look (e.g., "This approach ultimately..."). 1 sentence ideal for punch.

Your Example:

- Strengths: Weighs sides ("although throwing... few years"), clear preference.
- Teach: "Does not treat actual problem"—strong summary. Informal "throwing in jail" ok for tone, but formalize for Band 9.
- Improvement: "In conclusion, while incarceration provides temporary relief, medical intervention tackles addiction's core, yielding greater societal gains."

Common Error: New ideas—review: Does it introduce extras?

### Vocabulary (Advanced Bank + Usage)

Build range: Synonyms, collocations, idioms sparingly.

- **Views**: Advocate, contend, proponents/opponents.
- **Support**: Justify, substantiate, exemplify.
- **Contrast**: Notwithstanding, albeit, whereas.
- **Opinion**: I am inclined to, it strikes me that.
- **Impact**: Exacerbate, mitigate, ramifications.
- **Examples**: A case in point, as evidenced by.

Practice: Replace basics (e.g., "good" → "efficacious"). Aim 7+ vocab: No repetition, topic-specific (e.g., "recidivism" for crime).

### Additional Teaching: Full Essay Walkthrough + Practice

**Full Sample Essay (Drug Addicts Question)**:

Introduction: Some advocate imprisoning drug addicts for legal violations, while others view addiction as an illness requiring hospital care. Although jail removes immediate threats, I believe rehabilitation in medical facilities offers superior long-term solutions.

Body 1 (Jail): On one hand, incarceration deters drug use by isolating offenders. Governments argue it protects society from harm, like theft to fund habits. In the US, strict possession laws lead to year-long sentences, reducing street-level dealing. However, I disagree, as prisons often supply drugs, with 50% of inmates relapsing upon release.

Body 2 (Hospital): On the other hand, treating addicts medically addresses underlying issues like mental health. Compassionate care via therapy and supervised detox fosters recovery. Switzerland's free heroin program, for instance, slashed drug crime by 80%, proving efficacy. I fully support this, as it benefits individuals and cuts societal costs.

Conclusion: In conclusion, while prison provides short-term control, hospital-based rehabilitation resolves addiction effectively, promoting a healthier society.

**Band Breakdown**: Task Response 9 (full coverage), Coherence 9 (logical flow), Lexical 8 (varied), Grammar 9 (complex structures).

**Practice Exercise**:
