1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Structure of all Task 1 questions</mark>
	- **Question Statement**: This section varies depending on the specific task. For example, the question statement is: "The graphs above give information about computer ownership as a percentage of the population between 2002 and 2010, and by level of education for the years 2002 and 2010." This introduces the topic and the data to be analyzed, such as trends in computer ownership over time and its correlation with education levels.
	- **Instructions**: These are consistent across all Task 1 questions and typically include directives such as "Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant." Additionally, there is often a word count requirement, such as "Write at least 150 words," which ensures candidates provide a detailed response.
	- **Data Source**: There are seven types of data representations candidates might encounter:
	  - **Line Graph**: Shows trends over time, e.g., computer ownership percentages from 2002 to 2010.
	  - **Bar Chart**: Compares categories, such as ownership by education level in specific years.
	  - **Pie Chart**: Displays proportions, which could be used to show the distribution of computer owners by demographic.
	  - **Table**: Presents data in a tabular format, useful for detailed comparisons.
	  - **Multiple Graphs/Charts/Tables**: Combines various data types, requiring integration of information.
	  - **Process Diagram**: Illustrates a sequence or process, less common but possible in some tasks.
	  - **Map(s)**: Shows geographical changes or comparisons, typically involving spatial data.

2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">7 Types of question</mark>
	- **Line Graph**: Ideal for tracking changes over time, such as the steady increase in computer ownership from 2002 to 2010.
	- **Bar Chart**: Effective for comparing discrete categories, e.g., computer ownership across different education levels in 2002 and 2010.
	- **Pie Chart**: Useful for showing the percentage distribution of computer owners by age or region.
	- **Table**: Provides detailed numerical data, allowing precise comparisons across multiple variables.
	- **Multiple Graph/Charts/Tables**: Requires synthesizing data from various sources, enhancing analytical skills.
	- **Process Diagram**: Describes stages, such as the manufacturing process of computers, though less relevant here.
	- **Map(s)**: Depicts geographical data, possibly showing computer ownership by region, if applicable.

3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Dos and Don'ts</mark>

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Task Achievement Dos</mark>
	- **Identify key features**: Pinpoint the most significant trends, patterns, or differences in the data. For instance, in a bar chart, this might be the highest or lowest values or a notable contrast between categories.
	- **Report key features generally in overview**: Summarize the main trends in the introduction or overview paragraph without specific figures. This gives a broad picture, like "Overall, sales increased over the period."
	- **Report key features with specific data in details paragraphs**: In the body paragraphs, elaborate with precise data such as numbers, percentages, or time frames to back up the overview (e.g., "Sales rose from 200 units in 2010 to 350 units in 2015").
	- **Write over 150 words (165 is recommended)**: Meet the minimum word count requirement, aiming for around 165 words to ensure sufficient detail while keeping the response concise.

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Task Achievement Don'ts</mark>
	- **Write about everything you see**: Don’t list every detail in the data; prioritize the most relevant and impactful features to keep the response focused.
	- **Report data in the overview**: Avoid including specific numbers or data points in the overview; save these for the body paragraphs.
	- **Include opinion**: Stick to describing the data objectively—avoid personal thoughts like "This trend is surprising."
	- **Write a conclusion**: Task 1 doesn’t need a conclusion; the overview at the start fulfills that role.

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Coherence and Cohesion Dos</mark>
	- **Coherence** means your answer is logical, flows well, and is easy to follow, ensuring the reader can grasp your points effortlessly.
	- **Cohesion** means sentences and ideas connect smoothly using linking words or references, creating a unified response.
	- **Have a clear structure**: Use a consistent layout, such as an overview followed by two body paragraphs, each covering distinct data aspects.
	- **Organize information logically**: Arrange details in a sensible order, like chronological for time-based data or thematic for comparisons.
	- **Use linking words appropriately and accurately**: Include connectors like "furthermore," "on the other hand," or "in contrast" to clarify relationships between points.
	- **Use referencing**: Employ pronouns (e.g., "this figure," "these trends") to link back to earlier ideas, reducing repetition.

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Coherence and Cohesion Don'ts</mark>
	- **Write one long answer**: Break your response into paragraphs rather than a single block of text to improve readability.
	- **Try to get marks by using lots of linking words**: Don’t add linking words just for the sake of it—use them naturally where they enhance meaning.
	- **Overuse linking words**: Excessive use (e.g., "Moreover, in addition, furthermore" in one sentence) can make writing awkward.
	- **Try to find comparisons that are not there**: Don’t invent comparisons if the data doesn’t support them; stay true to what’s presented.

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Lexical Resource (Vocabulary) Dos</mark>
	- **Use a range of vocabulary**: Vary your word choice (e.g., "rose," "climbed," "surged") to show lexical flexibility.
	- **Use vocabulary for describing data accurately and appropriately**: Choose precise terms like "fluctuated," "peaked," or "declined" that match the data’s behavior.
	- **Use appropriate collocations**: Pair words naturally, such as "marked improvement," "gradual rise," or "sharp drop."
	- **Think accuracy first**: Focus on using words you’re confident with correctly rather than risking errors with unfamiliar ones.

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lexical Resource (Vocabulary) Don'ts</mark>
	- **Misspell words**: Spelling mistakes can lower your score, so double-check accuracy.
	- **Use words or phrases you don’t know 100%**: Avoid guessing vocabulary meanings, as misuse can confuse the reader.
	- **Repeat words from the question or data source**: Paraphrase instead of copying terms directly from the task or chart.
	- **Take risks with synonyms**: Don’t use a synonym unless you’re certain it fits the context perfectly.

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Grammar Dos</mark>
	- **Use appropriate structures**: Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences to demonstrate range (e.g., "While sales increased, profits remained stable”).
	- **Use the correct tense**: Match the tense to the data’s time frame—use past tense for historical data (e.g., "In 2010, sales reached 200 units").
	- **Use structures accurately**: Ensure grammatical constructions are error-free and clear.
	- **Use accurate punctuation**: Apply commas, periods, and other marks correctly to enhance readability.
	- **Think accuracy first**: Opt for grammatical correctness over complexity if unsure about advanced structures.

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Grammar Don’ts</mark>
	- **Make careless mistakes**: Avoid preventable errors like missing verbs or incorrect tense with careful review.
	- **Try to use as many different structures as possible**: Don’t sacrifice accuracy for variety—simple, correct sentences are better than flawed complex ones.
