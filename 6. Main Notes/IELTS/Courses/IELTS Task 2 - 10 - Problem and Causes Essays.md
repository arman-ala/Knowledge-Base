### What is a Problem and Solution Question?

Hey, these IELTS Task 2 essays ask you to identify problems (or causes) from a situation and propose solutions. You analyze impacts and fixes, not opinions. Examples:  
- "Many people strive to maintain a successful career and happy family life. What problems can this cause? What solutions?" (Problems + solutions.)  
- "Natural resources like water are overused. What's the main cause? How to solve?" (Cause + solution.)

### Difference Between Cause and Solution

Causes explain why a problem happens; solutions fix it.  
Example 1: Problem—failed IELTS. Cause—laziness. Solution—study harder.  
Example 2: Problem—late for work. Cause—video games all night. Solution—early bedtime.

### Common Mistakes

- Mixing causes with problems.  
- Ignoring singular/plural (e.g., "problem" means one idea).  
- Underdeveloping ideas or listing too many.  
- Treating it like opinion/discussion essays.

### Band 9 Checklist

- Intro states key problem/cause + solution.  
- One relevant problem/cause linked to solution, fully explained with examples.  
- Short conclusion recaps points.

### How Many Problems/Solutions?

Questions use plural ("problems/solutions") for 2 ideas each, or singular for 1. Two pairs need 350+ words—develop fully. Old rule (one pair) is outdated; now match the question.

### Structure Options

**Both Singular**:  
- Intro: Paraphrase + state problem/solution.  
- Para 2: Problem (state, explain, results, example).  
- Para 3: Solution (state, explain, example).  
- Conclusion: Summarize.

**Both Plural**:  
- Intro: Paraphrase + state problems/solutions.  
- Para 2: Problems (first: state/explain; second: state/explain + example).  
- Para 3: Solutions (first: state/explain; second: state/explain + example).  
- Conclusion: Summarize.

**One Plural + One Singular**:  
- Intro: Paraphrase + state.  
- Para 2: Problems (as plural).  
- Para 3: Solution (singular: state, explain, example).  
- Conclusion: Summarize.

### Sample Introduction

Many try to balance career success and family happiness. Main problems: exhaustion and child behavior issues. Best solution: scheduled family time.

### Sample Problems Paragraph (Plural)

Balancing career and family leads to burnout. It demands huge time, skipping rest. Kids of such parents misbehave more, as busy moms/dads ignore bad habits over guidance. E.g., Silicon Valley workers face long hours, causing more school behavior issues than average.

### Sample Solutions Paragraph (Singular)

Families should set strict family-only times. Parents pick daily slots—no work interruptions—for bonding. This relaxes parents from job stress; kids get undivided attention. E.g., global tradition of distraction-free dinners lets families share days.

### Outline and Sample Answer: Resources Question

**Outline**:  
- Intro: Paraphrase overuse; cause—Western waste; solution—youth education.  
- Para 2: Cause (wasteful habits explain overconsumption + example: US excess).  
- Para 3: Solution (educate kids on sustainability + example: school programs).  
- Conclusion: Recap.

**Sample Essay Snippet**:  
Intro: Earth's resources deplete fast. Chief cause: Western wasteful living. Key fix: Teach youth conservation.
