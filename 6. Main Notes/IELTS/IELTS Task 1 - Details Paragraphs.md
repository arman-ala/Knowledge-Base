In this module we will:
- Learn what is the difference between overview and details paragraphs.
- Work on golden rules.
- Write details for graphs over time.
- Write details for comparative graphs.
## What is the difference between overview and details paragraphs?
- Overview is simply the main ideas described generally.
- Details paragraphs describes these main ideas in more detail. For example:
	- **Important changes, numbers, differences and comparisons**.

## Golden Rules
- Do not describe every single piece of data.
- Make sure data is accurate
- Make sure you actually mention data. Every sentence should have a piece of data.
- Group data together logically.
- Make comparisons when relevant.

## Describing Data Over Time
- Main goal is to show the examiner that you understand the details and you can report them clearly.
- In the overview you described the data from start to finish i.e. general trends.
- In the details paragraphs you are going to describe the data in smaller parts.

**Detail Paragraph 1**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The number of burglaries rose slightly to around 3750 in 2004 and</mark> <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">then dropped sharply over the next four years to just above 1000</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Burglaries saw a slight increase in 2009 to just below 1500</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">and then remained relatively stable at around this level until the end of the period</mark>.
**Detail Paragraph 2**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The number of car thefts fluctuated slightly between the start of the period and 2009 between roughly 2300 and just above 2000</mark>. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It then increased steadily to its final level of approximately 2800 in 2012</mark>. 
## Comparing Data
- Here we take the most important features from the overview, and we describe them in more detail **using data**.

## Grouping Rules
- Most logical way for graph over time is normally by category.
- If two graphs will normally be one graph and then the other.
- For comparison graphs it will normally depend on the purpose.
