Here is a table of common Linux environment variables and the commands that typically change their values.

| Variable Name | Description | Commands That Change Its Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`PATH`** | A colon-separated list of directories where the shell looks for commands. | `export`, manual assignment (e.g., `PATH=$PATH:/new/dir`). |
| **`PWD`** | Stores the path of the **current working directory**. | `cd`. |
| **`OLDPWD`** | Stores the path of the **previous working directory**. | `cd -`. |
| **`USER`** | Stores the username of the **currently logged-in user**. | Typically set at login; not changed by regular commands. |
| **`HOME`** | The path to the **current user's home directory**. | Typically set at login; can be changed with `usermod` or in configuration files. |
| **`SHELL`** | Specifies the **path to the current user's shell program** (e.g., `/bin/bash`). | `chsh`. |
| **`LANG`** | Defines the **system's language and localization settings**. | `export` (e.g., `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`), system configuration files. |
| **`EDITOR`** | Sets the **default text editor** (used by `git`, `crontab`, etc.). | `export` (e.g., `export EDITOR=nano`). |
| **`HOSTNAME`** | The **name of the host/computer** on the network. | `hostnamectl`. |
| **`PS1`** | Defines the **format and content of the primary shell prompt**. | `export` (e.g., `export PS1="\u@\h:\w\$ "`). |

### ðŸ’¡ A Note on Variable Assignment and Scoping
When changing variables, remember the fundamental syntax: `VARIABLE_NAME=value` with **no spaces** around the equals sign. Whether a changed variable is available in sub-shells depends on how it's set:
- **Local Variable**: `MY_VAR=value` creates a variable available only in the current shell.
- **Environment (Global) Variable**: `export MY_VAR=value` makes the variable available to the current shell and all its child processes.
