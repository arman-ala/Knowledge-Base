## Storage Interface Evolution and Linux Device Naming

### Historical Timeline of Storage Interfaces

**1. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)**
- **Introduction**: 1970s-1980s
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Parallel interface technology
  - Dedicated controller cards
  - Support for multiple devices (8-16 per controller)
  - High reliability and performance
- **Linux Device Naming**: `/dev/sd[a-z]`

**Why SCSI Was Deprecated:**
- **Cost Complexity**: SCSI required expensive dedicated controller cards and specialized cables, making it prohibitively expensive for consumer markets
- **Configuration Complexity**: Setting termination, SCSI IDs, and bus mastering required technical expertise beyond typical users
- **Cable Limitations**: Parallel cables were bulky, limited in length (especially at higher speeds), and prone to signal interference

### Linux Device Detection and Naming Sequence

**Detection Order Protocol:**
```
1. SCSI Controllers and Devices
2. SATA Controllers and Devices  
3. USB Storage Devices
4. Other Mass Storage Devices
```

**Why This Order Matters:**
- **Historical Precedence**: SCSI was the original high-performance interface in Unix systems, giving it priority in detection
- **Boot Considerations**: Early systems often booted from SCSI devices, requiring them to be detected first
- **Driver Loading Sequence**: The kernel loads drivers in this order to ensure proper initialization
- **Stability**: Critical storage devices (typically internal) are detected before removable ones

**Naming Assignment Rules:**
- First detected SCSI device: `/dev/sda`
- Second detected SCSI device: `/dev/sdb`
- First SATA device: Next available letter (e.g., `/dev/sdc`)
- USB flash drives: Subsequent letters in detection order

**Implications for System Administration:**
- **Non-Persistent Naming**: Device names can change between reboots if hardware configuration changes
- **Detection Order Dependency**: Adding a new SCSI device might shift SATA device names
- **Boot Configuration Issues**: Systems configured to boot from `/dev/sda` might fail if detection order changes
- **Automation Challenges**: Scripts relying on device names may break if hardware is added or removed
