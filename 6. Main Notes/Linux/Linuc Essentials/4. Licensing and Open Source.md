# Understanding the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open Source Initiative (OSI): A Beginner-Friendly Guide

## Abstract

This document offers a clear and simple explanation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open Source Initiative (OSI), two key organizations in the world of software that can be freely shared and changed. It describes what each group stands for and lists their main rules in easy-to-understand language. The goal is to help newcomers grasp these ideas without needing any prior knowledge, using straightforward words and examples where helpful.

## What is the Free Software Foundation (FSF)?

The Free Software Foundation, or FSF, is a group that works to make sure software gives people full control over their computers. It was started by a person named Richard Stallman, who believes software should respect users' rights like freedom of speech. "Free" here means freedom, not zero cost—like being free to do what you want, not getting something for free at a store.

The FSF focuses on software that lets users run it however they like, look inside to see how it works, make changes, and share it with others. This is called "free software." It's different from "closed" software, where companies hide the inner workings and limit what you can do. The FSF has four main rules, called the "four essential freedoms," that define what makes software truly free. These rules ensure everyone can benefit from and improve the software together.

For example, think of free software like a recipe in a cookbook that anyone can read, change, and share. The FSF wants all software to be like that, so no one is locked out.

Best practice for beginners: If you're starting with software, look for programs labeled as "free software" to learn how they work and even try tweaking them yourself.

## The Four Essential Freedoms of the FSF

Here is a list of the FSF's four main rules, explained simply:

1. **The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).**  
   This means you can use the software for anything you want, like work, fun, or school. No one can stop you from running it on your computer.

2. **The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).**  
   You can look at the "source code" (the instructions that make the software) and fix or improve it. But you need access to that source code to do this—it's like having the full recipe, not just the baked cake.

3. **The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).**  
   You can give copies of the software to friends, family, or anyone else. This helps spread useful tools without restrictions.

4. **The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).**  
   If you change the software to make it better, you can share your new version with everyone. Again, source code access is key, so others can keep improving it too.

These rules make sure software stays open and helpful for the whole community.

## What is the Open Source Initiative (OSI)?

The Open Source Initiative, or OSI, is an organization that checks and approves licenses (legal agreements) for software that can be shared openly. "Open source" means the software's source code is available for anyone to see, use, and change. The OSI started to show how this kind of software can be good for businesses and developers, focusing on practical benefits like teamwork and faster improvements.

Unlike the FSF, which is more about ethics and user rights, the OSI is about making sure software can be freely distributed and modified in ways that work for everyone, including companies. For instance, open source software powers things like websites and apps you use every day, because teams can build on each other's work.

A tip for new users: Many popular programs, like web browsers, follow OSI rules, so you can try them without worry.

## The Ten Points of the OSI's Open Source Definition

The OSI has ten main rules that a license must follow to be called "open source." Here they are, listed and explained in simple terms:

1. **Free Redistribution.**  
   Anyone can sell or give away the software, even as part of a bigger collection from different sources. No fees or royalties are required for sharing.

2. **Source Code.**  
   The software must come with its source code, or there must be an easy, cheap way to get it (like downloading for free). The code can't be hidden or confusing on purpose.

3. **Derived Works.**  
   You can change the software and share your changes under the same rules as the original.

4. **Integrity of The Author’s Source Code.**  
   Changes might need to be shared as "patches" (small fixes) instead of full rewrites, to keep the original code clear. But you can still build and share modified versions, perhaps with a new name.

5. **No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups.**  
   The license can't block certain people or groups from using the software—it's open to everyone.

6. **No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor.**  
   You can use the software for any kind of work, like business or research, without limits.

7. **Distribution of License.**  
   When you share the software, the same rights automatically apply to the new users—no extra agreements needed.

8. **License Must Not Be Specific to a Product.**  
   The rules don't depend on the software being part of one particular package. If you take it out and use it elsewhere, the rights stay the same.

9. **License Must Not Restrict Other Software.**  
   The license can't control other programs shared with it. For example, it can't force everything on a CD to be open source too.

10. **License Must Be Technology-Neutral.**  
    The rules can't favor one type of technology or way of using it over another—it's fair for all setups.

These points help make open source software reliable and widely usable.

## Comparison Table of FSF and OSI Rules

To make it easier to see the differences, here is a table summarizing the rules for each:

| Organization | Number of Rules | Rule Focus | Key Examples |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| FSF | 4 Essential Freedoms | User rights and community sharing; strong emphasis on freedom and ethics. | Running for any purpose, studying and changing, redistributing copies, sharing modifications. |
| OSI | 10 Points of Definition | Practical distribution and modification; business-friendly and non-discriminatory. | Free redistribution, source code access, allowing derived works, no restrictions on fields or technologies.
