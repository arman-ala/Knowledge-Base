The most effective way to understand how an operating system works is through abstraction—a fancy way of saying that you can ignore most of the details that make up a piece that you’re trying to understand, and concentrate instead on its basic purpose and operation.

1. **The Bottom Layer: Hardware**  
   This is the physical foundation - all the actual computer parts. It includes:
   - The brain (CPU) that does all the calculations
   - The short-term memory (RAM) where active work happens
   - Storage (disks) for saving things long-term
   - Network connections for talking to other computers

2. **The Middle Layer: Kernel**  
   This is Linux's core - like the computer's manager. It's special software that:
   - Lives in memory and directs the CPU what to do next
   - Acts as a referee between programs and hardware
   - Especially manages memory carefully so programs don't interfere with each other
   - Handles all communication between software and hardware components

3. **The Top Layer: User Space**  
   This is where all your running programs live, collectively called "processes." Some things to know:
   - Whether it's your web browser or a background server, they're all user processes
   - Even if you can't see it (like a web server), if it's a running program, it's here
   - The kernel manages all these processes, giving them resources and keeping them organized

The kernel is like a translator and manager - it takes requests from programs and makes the actual hardware do the work, while keeping everything running smoothly.
