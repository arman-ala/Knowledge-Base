# Difference Between Virtualization and Hypervisor

[Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-virtualization-and-hypervisor/)

Hypervisors and virtualization are two of the most critical technologies in modern computing environments. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there is a clear distinction between them. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual copy of an entity, such as a server or an operating system</mark>, while a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hypervisor is the software or firmware layer responsible for implementing the virtualization process by managing virtual machines</mark>. Understanding this difference is crucial because it helps organizations effectively optimize their infrastructure and meaningfully expand their resources.

## What is Virtualization?

==Virtualization==, as the name suggests, is a technology that allows multiple operating system (OS) instances to run concurrently on a single physical machine. It can be applied to various components of a system, including CPU virtualization, memory virtualization, device virtualization, and I/O virtualization. By leveraging existing parts of the system, virtualization improves efficiency and performance through better resource balancing.

### Advantages of Virtualization

- **Cost Efficiency**: Virtualization reduces the need for physical hardware, which decreases both the costs of purchasing new equipment and the expenses associated with maintaining it.
- **Scalability**: It offers increased scalability and maintainability, making it easier to scale resources up or down without incurring significant costs for new hardware.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Virtualization simplifies disaster recovery by enabling the use of backup data in case of hardware failure.
- **Isolation**: It provides isolation by ensuring that each virtual machine (VM) runs in its own space, reducing the risk of resource conflicts between systems.

### Disadvantages of Virtualization

- **Performance Overhead**: The abstraction layer introduced by virtualization can lead to performance latency.
- **Complexity**: Managing a virtualized IT environment can be challenging and often requires trained personnel.
- **Initial Costs**: Although virtualization reduces long-term costs, the initial investment in software licenses and hardware can be expensive.

## What is a Hypervisor?

A ==hypervisor==, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software, hardware, or firmware component that enables virtualization. It creates a virtualization layer that separates physical resources—such as CPUs, RAM, and storage—from the virtual machines (VMs) that are created. There are two main types of hypervisors:
- **Type 1 (Bare-Metal)**: Runs directly on the host hardware.
- **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Runs on top of a host operating system.

The hypervisor allocates resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth to each VM, enabling guest operating systems and applications to run efficiently.

### Advantages of Hypervisors

- **Resource Management**: Hypervisors efficiently map physical resources to VMs, optimizing resource utilization.
- **Security**: They provide a strong level of isolation between VMs, reducing the risk of one VM being affected by another’s vulnerabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Hypervisors allow multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single hardware environment.

### Disadvantages of Hypervisors

- **Complexity**: Managing hypervisors can be challenging, especially in large-scale environments.
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple VMs running on the same host may compete for shared resources, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: If a hypervisor is compromised, all hosted VMs could be at risk, posing a significant security threat.

# **What are Hypervisors?**

A **hypervisor**, also known as a **virtual machine monitor (VMM)**, is a critical piece of software that enables multiple virtual machines (VMs)—each with its own operating system (OS)—to run on a single physical server. The hypervisor pools and allocates physical computing resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth to the VMs as needed, enabling efficiency, flexibility, and scalability. 

## **How Hypervisors Work**

The hypervisor acts as an intermediary between the physical hardware and the virtual machines, managing the allocation of resources like memory, bandwidth, and storage for each VM . It ensures that VMs are logically separated from one another, assigning each its own slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage. This isolation prevents VMs from interfering with each other. For example, if one OS crashes or is compromised, the others remain unaffected.

Before hypervisors became mainstream, most physical computers could only run one operating system at a time. While this approach provided stability because the hardware only had to handle requests from a single OS, it often led to wasted resources since the OS couldn't always utilize all of the computer's power. A hypervisor solves this problem by enabling multiple instances of operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources—a process known as **virtualization**.

### **Virtual Machines vs. Virtual Servers**
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: These are software emulations of physical computers that run on a host machine. Each VM operates as if it has its own dedicated hardware.
- **Virtual Servers**: These are made possible by hypervisors that act as a layer between the physical hardware and multiple unique virtual environments. Virtual servers replicate physical, bare-metal servers for applications like web servers, domain name servers, proxy servers, etc.

## **Types of Hypervisors**

There are two main types of hypervisors: **Type 1** and **Type 2**.

### **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)**
- **Definition**: A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the underlying computer's physical hardware, interacting directly with its CPU, memory, and storage. For this reason, it is also referred to as a **bare-metal hypervisor** or **native hypervisor**.
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly efficient because it directly accesses physical hardware.
  - Increased security due to minimal layers between the hypervisor and the hardware.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used in enterprise data centers and cloud computing environments.
- **Examples**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix Hypervisor, Linux KVM .

### **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)**
- **Definition**: A Type 2 hypervisor does not run directly on the hardware but instead runs as an application within an existing operating system (OS). It is suitable for individual PC users who need to run different operating systems.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to set up and use for end-users.
  - Supports productivity by allowing quick access to alternative guest OS alongside the primary OS.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Introduces latency issues because it must access resources via the host OS.
  - Potential security risks if the host OS is compromised.
- **Use Cases**: Engineers, security professionals analyzing malware, and business users needing access to applications unavailable on their primary OS.
- **Examples**: Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Pro, Parallels Desktop .

## **Hypervisors in Virtual Desktop Integration (VDI)**

Type 1 hypervisors are not limited to server virtualization; they can also virtualize desktop operating systems. This capability is leveraged in **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**, which delivers complete desktop virtualization environments—including operating systems, applications, files, and user preferences—from the cloud. 

In a VDI setup:
- A hypervisor runs multiple virtual desktops, each sitting in its own VM, grouped into collections called **virtual desktop pools**.
- Users access these desktops over the network using thin clients or mobile devices, ensuring consistent access to the same desktop OS across devices without compromising security .
