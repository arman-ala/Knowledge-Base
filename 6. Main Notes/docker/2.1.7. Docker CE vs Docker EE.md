The development and maintenance of Docker are managed by Docker Inc. Within this company, there is a project known as the **Moby Project**, which serves as an open-source umbrella for Docker's components and tools. The Moby Project is divided into two main branches, each targeting different use cases:

1. **Docker Community Edition (CE)**:
   - Docker CE is the free, open-source version of Docker, designed for developers and small to medium-sized teams who want to build, test, and deploy containerized applications. It provides all the essential features required for containerization and is widely used in development environments.
   - Despite being the "community" version, Docker CE has proven to be highly reliable and capable, with many large companies successfully using it in production without any significant limitations.

2. **Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)**:
   - Docker EE is the commercial version of Docker, aimed at enterprise customers who require advanced features such as enhanced security, centralized management, certification, and official support from Docker Inc.
   - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">While the core engine of both Docker CE and Docker EE is identical, Docker EE includes additional enterprise-focused capabilities, such as integrated access control, advanced security scanning for images, and compliance tools.</mark> These features make it suitable for organizations that need to meet strict regulatory requirements or manage large-scale deployments across multiple environments.

Although Docker EE is marketed as the "better" option due to its enterprise-grade features, Docker CE is more than sufficient for most use cases and has been adopted by numerous large organizations without any noticeable drawbacks. The choice between CE and EE largely depends on the specific needs of the user or organization, such as the scale of operations, compliance requirements, and the need for professional support. 

In addition to these distinctions, Docker Inc. actively collaborates with the open-source community through the Moby Project to ensure continuous innovation and improvement of Docker's core technologies. This collaboration allows Docker to remain flexible and adaptable to emerging trends in cloud computing, microservices, and container orchestration.
