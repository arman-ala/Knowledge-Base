### What is docker stats?

docker stats is a command in Docker that provides a live stream of resource usage statistics for your running containers. It’s like having a fitness tracker for your containers—it tells you how much "energy" (CPU, memory, etc.) they’re using at any given moment. This is super useful for debugging performance issues, optimizing resource allocation, or just keeping tabs on your containers to ensure they’re running smoothly.

When you run docker stats, it displays a table with columns showing various metrics for each container. By default, it updates every second, giving you a real-time view of what’s happening. You can use this command to monitor all running containers or specify particular ones to focus on.

### Explaining the Columns of the `docker stats` Table

Let’s go through each column in the table and what it means:

- **CONTAINER ID**: This is a unique identifier for each container. In your image, the IDs are things like ec74d3851346, d7dbc595f4b6, etc. These are shortened versions of the full container IDs (Docker typically shows the first 12 characters for brevity).
- **NAME**: The name of the container. In your case, the containers are named limit_centos5, limit_centos4, limit_centos3, limit_centos2, and limit_centos1. These names are likely user-defined (you can set them when you run a container with the --name flag in docker run).
- **CPU %**: This shows the percentage of the host’s CPU that the container is using. In your image, all containers are at 0.00%, meaning they’re not using any CPU at the moment—they’re probably idle.
- **MEM USAGE / LIMIT**: This column shows how much memory the container is using compared to its memory limit. For example, for limit_centos5, it’s using 816KiB out of a limit of 1.633GiB. The memory usage is very low here (less than 1 MiB for most containers), and the limits vary—some containers have a limit of 1.633GiB, while others have 150MiB.
- **MEM %**: This is the percentage of the memory limit that the container is using. For limit_centos5, it’s 0.05% (816 KiB out of 1.633 GiB is a tiny fraction). For limit_centos1, it’s 0.60% (924 KiB out of 150 MiB).
- **NET I/O**: This shows the network input/output for the container (data sent and received). For example, limit_centos5 has 2.3KB / 126B, meaning it has sent 2.3 KB and received 126 bytes of data over the network. These are very small amounts, indicating minimal network activity.
- **BLOCK I/O**: This shows the disk input/output (data read from and written to the disk). In your image, most containers show 0B / 0B, meaning no disk I/O activity, except for limit_centos1, which has 2.2MB / 0B—it has read 2.2 MB from the disk but hasn’t written anything.
- **PIDS**: This stands for "Process IDs" and shows the number of processes running inside the container. All containers in your image have 1 PID, meaning each container is running just one process. This is typical for lightweight containers that are designed to run a single service.

### Flags for docker stats

The docker stats command comes with several flags (options) that let you customize its behavior. Here’s a list of all the flags and what they do:

- **--all, -a**: By default, docker stats only shows stats for running containers. If you use this flag, it will show stats for all containers, including those that are stopped. Stopped containers will typically show zero usage for most metrics.
- **--format**: This flag lets you customize the output format using a Go template. For example, you could use --format "{{.Name}}: {{.CPUPerc}}" to only show the container name and CPU percentage. This is useful if you want to extract specific data or format it for scripting.
- **--no-stream**: By default, docker stats streams the stats in real time, updating every second. If you use this flag, it will show the stats just once and then exit, giving you a snapshot instead of a live feed.
- **--no-trunc**: By default, Docker truncates long values (like container IDs) for readability. If you use this flag, it will show the full, untruncated values. For example, instead of ec74d3851346, you’d see the full 64-character container ID.
- **Container names or IDs (optional)**: You can specify one or more container names or IDs at the end of the command (e.g., docker stats limit_centos1 limit_centos2). This will limit the output to only those containers instead of showing all running ones.
