The `docker events` command is a super handy tool for monitoring real-time activity in your Docker environment. It listens for events generated by Docker objects like containers, images, networks, and volumes, giving you a live stream of what’s happening on your Docker host. Think of it as a live feed of Docker’s activity log—perfect for debugging, monitoring, or just keeping an eye on your system.

When you run `docker events`, it starts streaming events as they happen, such as when a container is created, started, stopped, or deleted, or when an image is pulled or pushed. Each event comes with a timestamp, the type of event, and details about the object involved (like the container name or ID). In the screenshot you shared, you can see `docker events` in action, capturing things like container starts, network connections, and more, all with detailed timestamps and metadata.

You can also filter events to focus on specific types or objects (e.g., only container events or events for a specific container). The command runs continuously until you stop it (usually with Ctrl+C), but you can also use flags to limit the time range or scope of events.

### Table of `docker events` Flags

Here’s a table listing all the flags for the `docker events` command, along with what they do:

| Flag              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-f`, `--filter`  | Filters events based on conditions (e.g., `container=<name>`, `type=container`, `event=start`). You can use multiple filters. |
| `--format`        | Formats the output using a Go template (e.g., `{{.ID}} {{.Type}} {{.Action}}`). Useful for customizing the event display. |
| `--since`         | Shows events created since a specific timestamp (e.g., `2025-04-01T10:00:00` or `10m` for 10 minutes ago). |
| `--until`         | Shows events created up to a specific timestamp (e.g., `2025-04-01T12:00:00` or `5m` for 5 minutes ago). |
| `-h`, `--help`    | Displays the help message for the `docker events` command.                 |

These flags give you a lot of control over what events you see and how they’re displayed. For example, in your screenshot, the command `docker events --filter 'name=centos_events'` is filtering events to only show those related to a container named `centos_events`.

### Where Is the Data for `docker events` Stored in Linux?

On a Linux system, the data for `docker events` isn’t stored in a traditional file that you can directly access. Instead, Docker generates these events in real-time by interacting with the Docker daemon. The events are sourced from the Docker daemon’s runtime activity, and `docker events` essentially taps into this live stream.

However, the Docker daemon does log its activity, which includes the events you see with `docker events`. These logs are typically stored in the Docker daemon’s log file, which depends on your system’s configuration:

- **Default Location**: On most Linux systems using `systemd` (like Ubuntu or CentOS), the Docker daemon logs are managed by `journald`. You can view them using:
  ```
  journalctl -u docker
  ```
  This will show the Docker daemon’s logs, which include the events that `docker events` streams.

- **Custom Log Location**: If you’ve configured Docker to use a different logging driver (e.g., `json-file`), the daemon logs might be stored in `/var/lib/docker/daemon.log` or a similar location, depending on your setup. You can check the Docker daemon’s configuration file (usually `/etc/docker/daemon.json`) to see the logging settings:
  ```
  {
    "log-driver": "json-file",
    "log-opts": {
      "max-size": "10m",
      "max-file": "3"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Event Persistence**: The `docker events` command itself doesn’t store events—it streams them live. If you want to persist events, you’d need to redirect the output to a file (e.g., `docker events > events.log`) or use a monitoring tool that captures and stores Docker events, like Prometheus with a Docker exporter.

In short, the raw data for events comes from the Docker daemon’s runtime, and the closest thing to a “storage” location is the daemon’s logs, typically accessible via `journalctl` or a configured log file.
