## Volumes Deletion
To delete a Docker volume, we use the `docker volume rm` command. For example:
```bash
docker volume rm myvol
```
This command removes the specified volume (`myvol`) only if it is not actively being used by any container. If the volume is still attached to a container, even if the container is stopped, Docker will prevent us from deleting it to avoid data loss.

We cannot delete a volume that is associated with a container without first removing the container. This is because Docker ensures data integrity and prevents accidental deletion of volumes that might still be needed. To remove both the container and its associated volume, we can use the following commands:
```bash
docker rm -v centos_bash
```
Here, the `-v` flag ensures that any anonymous volumes associated with the container are also removed. However, for named volumes, we must explicitly delete them using `docker volume rm`.

## Dangling Volumes
Dangling volumes are volumes that are no longer associated with any container. These typically occur when:
1. A container is deleted without removing its associated volumes.
2. A volume was created but never actually used by any container.

For example:
```bash
docker run -it --name centos_bash -v myvol:/data centos:latest
docker rm centos_log
```
In this case, even though the `centos_log` container is removed, the `myvol` volume remains on the system as a dangling volume.

Dangling volumes can consume disk space unnecessarily, and managing them is essential to keep the Docker environment clean.

## Using `docker volume prune`
The `docker volume prune` command is specifically designed to clean up unused or dangling volumes. It removes all volumes that are not currently in use by any container. Here's how we use it:
```bash
docker volume prune
```
When executed, Docker will prompt us for confirmation before proceeding with the cleanup. This command is particularly useful for reclaiming disk space and maintaining a tidy Docker environment.

Key points about `docker volume prune`:
- It only removes volumes that are not associated with any container (dangling volumes).
- It does not affect volumes that are currently in use by running or stopped containers.
- It is a safe operation since Docker will not delete any volume that might still hold important data.

Example scenario:
1. Create a volume and attach it to a container:
```bash
docker volume create myvol
docker run -it --name centos_bash -v myvol:/data centos:latest
```

2. Remove the container:
```bash
docker rm centos_log
```

3. Prune unused volumes:
```bash
docker volume prune
```
After pruning, the `myvol` volume will be deleted because it is no longer associated with any container.
