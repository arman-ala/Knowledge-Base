We discussed Docker images, but where can we obtain these images? They are stored in a **Docker registry** , which serves as a repository for Docker images. A Docker registry comes in two types: **private** and **public** .

- **Public registries** are accessible over the internet and include platforms like **Docker Hub** , **AWS** , and others. These are considered public because anyone can access them.
- **Private registries** , on the other hand, are internal to organizations and are used to store images securely within an organization's infrastructure.

To run a container, the required image must be available **locally** on the system. If it is not already present, Docker will pull it from a registry (either public or private).

One of the advantages of having a **local private Docker registry** is that if someone in the organization requests an image—say, for **nginx** —and it is not available locally, the local registry will fetch it from Docker Hub. In addition to serving the image to the requester, it will also cache the image locally. This way, subsequent requests for the same image do not require fetching it again from an external source, reducing wait times and network usage.

Beyond Docker registries, there are also tools for **repository management** , such as **Nexus** and **Artifactory** , which provide advanced features for managing and organizing images.

Inside each registry, there are **repositories** . Each repository contains multiple versions of images related to a specific application or service. These repositories act as containers for all the iterations or variants of an application's images.
