## **How Docker Containers Handle Read/Write Operations**

When you run a Docker container and perform read/write operations, things work a bit differently compared to a regular process on your system. If it were just a process, the operating system would manage all the disk I/O through its kernel and filesystem, handling tasks like reading and writing data seamlessly. However, with a Docker container, there's an additional layer involved: the storage driver. This component, sometimes called a graph driver in older Docker documentation, is responsible for managing how container images and their writable layers are stored on disk. Essentially, it handles the low-level details of reading from and writing to the disk, ensuring that the container's filesystem works efficiently.

### **Available Storage Drivers in Docker**

Docker supports several storage drivers, each with its own strengths depending on your system and workload. The oldest one is **aufs**, which was Docker's original storage driver but is now less common due to its dependency on specific kernel modules. **overlay2** is widely recommended for modern setups because it’s fast, efficient, and well-supported on most Linux distributions—it’s often the default choice these days. **devicemapper** is useful for older systems or specific use cases like direct-lvm mode for production environments, though it can be trickier to configure. **btrfs** and **zfs** are great if you’re already using these filesystems on your host, as they leverage native snapshotting and other advanced features, but they require more setup and aren’t as widely used.

### **Configuring the Storage Driver**

To set a specific storage driver, you’ll need to edit the Docker configuration file at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. You can specify your preferred driver by adding this JSON snippet: `{"storage-driver": "overlay2"}`. However, changing the storage driver isn’t something to take lightly—it can lead to issues if not done carefully. If you switch drivers without preparing properly, your existing images and containers might become inaccessible because different storage drivers manage data in incompatible ways. To avoid losing your work, you need to follow a careful process.

#### Steps to Safely Change the Storage Driver

Here’s how to safely change your storage driver while keeping your images and containers intact: First, save your images using the `docker save` command, which exports them as tar files. Next, push these saved images to a container registry, like Docker Hub or a private repo, to ensure you have a backup. Then, update the storage driver in the `daemon.json` file as mentioned earlier. After that, restart the Docker daemon—on most systems, you can do this with `sudo systemctl restart docker`, but make sure no containers are running first, or they’ll be terminated. Once Docker is back up, pull the images you saved earlier from the registry using `docker pull` to bring them back locally. Finally, restart your containers with `docker run` or `docker start`, and you should be good to go. This process ensures your data stays safe, but always double-check for any volumes or container-specific data that might need extra care during the switch.
