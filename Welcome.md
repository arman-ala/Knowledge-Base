I have 6 main folders in this vault:
1. Rough Notes
>In this folder, I save temporary notes, ideas, reminders, etc.
2. Source Material
>Insights from anything consumed by me, is stored right here. There are sub-folders to separate different source of learning such as videos, books, etc.
>You may find some files outside of all of the sub-folders, these are called active files, meaning that the writing of those are not completed yet.
3. Tags
>Each tag is just an empty file.
4. Indexes
>When the count of a Tag file relations gets high, the file can be used as an indexing  reference.
5. Templates
>This folder keeps your notes templates. It's good to have a structure to use as your writing pattern.
6. Main Notes
Some people call it "Atomic Notes" or "Zettelkasten". This is where all of the notes are stored.
